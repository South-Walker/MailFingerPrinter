Tana,

Please prepare the ISDA draft for a master swap contract between ENA and The 
Boeing Company per the terms in the attached credit worksheet.

FYI, I'll be relocating to our Portland office effective Monday, 8/7, and 
will not be in the Portland office til noon WST (2:00 pm your time.)

Regards,
Tracy
