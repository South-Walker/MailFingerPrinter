For clarification, the BOM Dec Sales to any of the three IOU's should be done 
through the BILATERAL market between EPMI and the Counterparty directly.

Any forward transactions beyond December must be approved by Credit on a 
deal-by-deal basis.

Please direct any questions to me 503-464-8755 (or cell 503-807-5633) or Bill 
Bradford in Houston (713-853-3831).
