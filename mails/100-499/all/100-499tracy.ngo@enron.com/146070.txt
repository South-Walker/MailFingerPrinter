Joram/Yair,

All I did was "hide" some columns that were not necessary and made the 
spreadsheet fit to one letter sized page.  This is the same spreadsheet that 
Enron provided to you yesterday evening that you have checked out with.  
Please let me know if you need anything changed on this.

I'll be waiting on your 'polished' physical power spreadsheet in similar 
format to Enron's for easy comparison.  Lastly, I'll also wait on your 
'reformatted' financial power spreadsheet.

Thanks,
Tracy
