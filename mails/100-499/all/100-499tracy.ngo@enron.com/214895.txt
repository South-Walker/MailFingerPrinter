Bill and Legal Team:

Ed and Melissa worked on the confirms based on the latest format for ring trades (taken from the aep/allegheny rings recently done) for the two sets of rings between EPMI/PGET/Constellation.  I have reviewed all attachments and they look fine.

Please review.  I will assume that legal will be forwarding a template or these drafts on to the counterparties.

Thanks,
Tracy
