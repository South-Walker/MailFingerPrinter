It's the same cp, but the name clarification will need to be made.

This entity is not set up in Global Counterparty, unless it is the record 
"California Department of Water Resources."  Do I need to set up a new CP or 
is this a name change?  Is Calfornia Energy Resource Schedulers affiliated 
somehow?
