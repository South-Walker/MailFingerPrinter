Subject: Updated CA PX and ISO for EPMI and Portland General

Bill,

Attached please find updated California PX and ISO outstanding exposures as 
of 3/9/01 for both EPMI and Portland General (Sheet 1).  Please also note 
that Sheet 2 details the collateral that EPMI currently has in escrow with 
the PX.

Volume Management and I will meet on a weekly basis (each Friday) to gather 
any updates for this report or more frequently as deemed necessary.  I have 
also asked Tyesha Woods, credit manager at Portland General, to provide me 
with email/fax updates as they occur.

Please let me know if you have any questions to the aforementioned.  I will 
also be sending this email to outside bankrupcy counsel (Le Boef's attorney, 
Jim Moeller in their Denver office).

Regards,
Tracy
