Samantha,

Per our conversation, attached please find a credit worksheet for a draft 
Master ISDA Agreement between ENA and Department of Water Resources, a 
division of The State of California.  I recently spoke with Christian Yoder, 
who has more insight on DWR from a legal reps/warranties perspective.  Given 
the short time frame that we're under, he indicated that the Swap Legal Group 
can just provide a draft ISDA based on the attached credit terms without the 
financial legal eligibility details.

Christian Yoder will work with Sara Shackleton at a later time to iron out 
any eligibility issues, etc.  Should the swap legal team have any further 
questions regarding the above, please contact Christian Yoder in Portland.

Please call w/any questions to the credit terms that I have provided.  Thanks 
for your immediate attention.

Regards,
Tracy
