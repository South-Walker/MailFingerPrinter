Tracy:
Could you please e-mail to the group the 11/8 letter that you sent to Mark Russell at SRP.  We received a letter on 11/9 stating that they disagreed with our assertion that SRTP's request for additional collateral is subject to the disputes resolution section of the Agreement.  Who is handling this on the legal side?
