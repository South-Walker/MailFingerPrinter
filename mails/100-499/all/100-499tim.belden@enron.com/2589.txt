I regret to announce that Greg Wolfe has tendered his resignation.  His last day with Enron was yesterday.  Greg has made tremendous contributions to Enron over the last eight years and this office in the last four years.  I am sorry to see him go.  

Greg has not yet indicated what he will be doing next, although he has told me that he intends to stay in Portland.  Please join me in wishing Greg well in his future endeavors.
