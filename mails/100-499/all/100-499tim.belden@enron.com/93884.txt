The people on the list for VM should be:

Scotty Gilbert
Eugene Lee
Donna Sheidun
Heather Dunton



Heather is currently in Risk but they may have to reduce from 3 to 2 in that group.  Scotty agreed to take Heather in VM.  In the event that Heather can remain in the Risk Group, then Kit Blair should be added to the VM team.  Call me if you have any questions.  Stacey will let me know by Sunday where Heather sits relative to Risk.
