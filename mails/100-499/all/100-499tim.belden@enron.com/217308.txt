I have discussed relocating Shari to Portland with both of you.  Elizabeth 
wanted to make sure that she had hired at least one additional attorney 
before Shari could move to Portland.  When I spoke to Mark earlier this week 
he indicated that January 1st  was a reasonable deadline.  I would like to 
get some closure/finality on this matter -- both from a business perspective 
and to allow Shari to know what the future holds.  Let me know your thoughts.
