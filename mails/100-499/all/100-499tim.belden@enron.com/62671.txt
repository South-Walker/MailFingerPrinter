i may be heading to houston next week to talk with the east desk about scheduling and settlement systems.  murray o'neil from volume management and jeff richter from short term california will be with me.  i'd arrive wednesday night and fly back friday afternoon.  do you and/or john want to meet with me when i'm there.  if so, do either of those days work for you?

Well - there you go!  I did think you meant p&l  - not to worry it was obviously a long day yesterday.

Have a good day.

100 what?  i mentioned a $100 price move in the fronts.  did you understand a $100 of p&l?  i thought that you sounded a bit happy about the price move.  the p&l was what i expected.
