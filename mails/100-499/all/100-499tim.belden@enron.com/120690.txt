I am giving a speech in Santa Fe in a couple of weeks.  One of the points 
that I want to make is that California set up the rules, made a strategic bet 
to go short, decided to buy all of their power on the spot market, and is now 
crying that their massive bet didn't work.  I remember reading an article in 
the San Diego Tribune from sometime in 1998 or 1999 with a quote from Steve 
Peace.  Peace talked about how the state of California ripped off a bunch of 
dumb out of state generators and wisely solved their stranded cost problem.  
Does anybody remember this article?  Does anybody have this article?  Is 
there a service that we can use to find it if we don't have it?  Let me know.
