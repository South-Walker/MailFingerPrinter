this just in from our nuke guy.

Subject: PaloVerde 3


Palo Verde 3 began their refueling outage this past weekend.  During
inspections at Mode 5 (cold shutdown) they discovered a couple cracks
(leaks) in their reactor coolant system.  One was at a temperature detector,
the other was at the pressurizer.  The refueling outage had been expected to
last about a month (restart 10/30/01).  These cracks may delay restart due
to very heightened NRC concern about this kind of cracking.  We will keep
you posted on plans and schedule changes for this outage.
