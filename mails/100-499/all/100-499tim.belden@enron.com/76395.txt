Sean asked me to look into the timing of price cap decisions.  Here's what it looks like:

November 7th		Commission meets but highly unlikely that they adress NW price cap
November 9th		Written comments due to FERC
November 13th ish	FERC posts agenda for November 20th meeting
November 20th		FERC likely issues order on NW caps

Tim, the issue is not on the agenda for the Commission's meeting on November 7.  This is no surprise, however, since written comments are still pending and not due until November 9 (Alan is preparing ours with my back-up).  Pat Wood said at the last Commission meeting that he doesn't wish to issue significant orders between meetings, so it is unlikely that FERC will act before its next scheduled meeting.  There is time pressure because winter is advancing.  Therefore our educated guess is that the order would issue at the next meeting following submittal of the comments, to be held on November 20.  The meeting agenda for this meeting will be available on the 13th or 14th; as soon as it issues we will let you know if it appears on the agenda.  In the meantime, if we hear anything more definitive we will let you know right away.  Ray

When is FERC going to rule on this?
