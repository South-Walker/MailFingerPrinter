Chip,

I have a new critical vendor with a prepetition invoice.  Arizona Public Service provides us critical transmission between the major trading points in the Southwest.  We owe them $43,708.60 for November transmission charges.  They will cut us if we do not pay.  I have explained that this payment needs to go through the creditor's cash approval process.

They can cut us starting tomorrow, but have agreed to a stay if we pay our December invoice of $8,071.20.  I will be faxing this invoice for immediate payment.

Steve
