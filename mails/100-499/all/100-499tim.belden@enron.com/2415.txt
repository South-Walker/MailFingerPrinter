I am trying to put together a reference sheet for important power trading numbers and conversions.  This will be used as part of a training course put on by Jon Koomy.  For example:
8760 hours per year.
On Peak hours are roughly 56% per year and off peak hours are roughly 44% per year.
One natural gas futures contract contains 10,000 MMBtu's



Please help me with this exercise.  Think about what number you use everyday and write them down for me by the end of Monday.

Thanks.
