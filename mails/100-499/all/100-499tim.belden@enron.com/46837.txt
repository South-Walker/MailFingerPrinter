The year-end performance review process is upon us.  I will send out a 
complete list of procedures and deadlines in the next few days.  In the 
meantime, we need to get each person's selection for reviewers into the 
system.  Amy Fitzpatrick has kindly volunteered to coordinate this process 
and make sure that all of the information gets into the system.  You need to 
select 5 people from the floor and up to 3 people from off the floor (if you 
have worked with people outside of the Portland office).  You can select 
anybody (except your manager), with the goal of getting 360 degree feedback 
from peers, people who you work with, people whose work you impact, people 
with a higher title, and/or people with a lower title.

HERE IS WHAT I NEED YOU TO DO ASAP (CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MONDAY AT THE 
LATEST):
Send an e-mail to Amy Fitzpatrick and your manager listing 5 people on the 
floor who you would like to provide feedback on you.
List the people in preference order.
Include up to 3 additional people who are not on the floor, but work at Enron.
Do not include your manager as a reviewer -- your manager already is 
responsible for reviewing your performance.
You do NOT have to enter these names into the PEP system.  We will do it for 
you.
