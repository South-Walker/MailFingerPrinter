Like most people, I heard on the news that the auction is done and that the winner is UBS.  I have not received confirmation of this from my management.  As soon as I hear anything official I will call a floor meeting to share what I know.

If I hear nothing official by 2 PM I'll hold a floor meeting at that time to share what I know (or perhaps don't know).  I am hopeful that we will have information within a couple of hours.  Stay tuned.
