Mark -- attached is the revised Posting Agreement.  Andy and Louise are 
catching an early flight tomorrow, so it won't do any good to e-mail this to 
them.  Andy said he would be happy if you would just forward it on to S&C in 
preparation for the meeting.

This is still pretty rough, but I guess it isn't bad for a working draft.  I 
hope that the drafting session is helpful, and again, I'm happy to sit in on 
it (although I don't think any of us would get that much out of it if I were 
to do that).
