Drew and I have spoken about his suggested changes to the co-marketing agre=\
ement regarding the annual mail-out.  I understand the issue to be that ann=\
ual mailout to the EnronOnline customer list that we are giving under the s=\
tock purchase agreement needs to stand on its own as very valuable consider=\
ation (and it is).  The annual mail-out previously referenced in the co-mar=\
keting agreement is so similar to the initial mail-out in the stock purchas=\
e agreement, that a conclusion could be reached that the annual PR campaign=\
 is the real consideration for the 12.5% stock (i.e., that it really takes =\
annual mailings by Enron before Kiodex gets any value out of Enron having d=\
one the mailout to its customer list).   Drew indicated that other co-marke=\
ting efforts would probably be OK, just not the same ones that we used to g=\
et the 12.5%.  Based on this, I have prepared the following revision of Dre=\
w's suggestion (since we don't know what that distribution will look like t=\
oday, I believe we need the items in (i), (ii) and (iii) to limit our expos=\
ure on this obligation.   =20\

At least once during each twelve-month period during the term of this Agree=\
ment, Enron and Kiodex will cooperate in an annual distribution of marketin=\
g and promotional materials with respect to the Kiodex Application, provide=\
d that (i) any such materials to be distributed shall be in form and substa=\
nce mutually acceptable to Enron and Kiodex; (ii) the timing, manner, and t=\
argeted audience of such distribution shall be mutually agreeable to Kiodex=\
 and Enron; (ii) any materials distributed to Enron Customers that are not =\
also Kiodex Customers may only be distributed by Enron and must market or p=\
romote the Kiodex Application as an additional functionality of the Enron W=\
eb Site available through the Kiodex Lite Tool; and (iii) no such distribut=\
ion shall result in any expense (including labor and materials) in excess o=\
