For what it is worth, I thought the most relevant portions of the EnronOnline website for VE's purposes are the following:
 
 
Tour
Markets
Legal and Privacy Statement
Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application (these are customized for every jurisdiction -- I would just print out North America version for now)
About EnronOnline
Site Map
Press Room (all press releases)
Market Presentations -- just the general ones
 
Each of these has a number of subtopics and numeous pages that would have to be printed, and upon further review, they may refer to other pages or materials that should be reviewed as well.
