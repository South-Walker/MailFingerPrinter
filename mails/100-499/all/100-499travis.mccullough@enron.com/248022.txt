Attached are the most current drafts of the Password Application, Terms and 
Conditions of Use, and Electronic Transactions Agreement.  Each of these 
documents is taken from the EOL model, revised as necessary to work for 
Clickpaper.  In particular (i) the Password Application does not address the 
"Master Use"; and (ii) the ETA has an additional section not found in the EOL 
ETA  (Section 4, which deals with trading on Match).

Please note that while I have discussed these documents with Mark Taylor and 
Harry Collins, they are reviewing them at the same time as everyone else, and 
may have comments.

The Privacy Policy, which is a short document (1/2 page) will be coming 
shortly.  Please call me with comments or questions.
