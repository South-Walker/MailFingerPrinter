Attached is a revised version of the Posting Agreement for your review.   I 
have also attached our position with respect to that portion of HoustonStreet 
equity that may be retained by Enron upon termination of the Posting 
Agreement under various circumstances.

I did not have a complete distribution list of all HoustonStreet parties that 
should receive a copy of this message, so please pass it on to anyone that 
may have been left off.  

Please do not hesitate to contact Andy Zipper or me with any comments or 
questions regarding the attached.
