Elizabeth:
 
Here is the draft.  To the extent that it is helpful, EPMI is where PGET was in the last deal; Party A is where EPMI was last time; and Party B is Avista.  It's late, and the document is getting confusing, so I'm sending it to you now without proofing it.  I'm taking it home with me and will read it again tonight.  Have an 8:00 conference call in Mary Cook's office or in the office that I am sitting in right now (Harry Collins' old office).
 
Take care.
