I have not been able to locate any other term sheets that are tailor-made to purchases of oil and gas properties (most of the documents we have are related to financing someone else's acquisition of properties).  However, Nancy Corbet has a template for an oil and gas property purchase and sale agreement that we could review and use to "beef up" our standard LOI and term sheet if you wanted to go that route.  Let either of us know if you want to see that document, or if we can help out on the project.
