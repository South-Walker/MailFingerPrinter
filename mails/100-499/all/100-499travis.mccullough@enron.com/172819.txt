I think we are finishing tomorrow.  At least, I'm finished tomorrow --- don't know about anyone else.  Conference call at 7:00 a.m. to discuss the Enron Corp. opinion with the banks.
 
I know you didn't mean for this to end up on my plate ... but it probably would have anyway, just because of the volatile nature of the issue.  I'll let you know what happens.

Hi Travis,
 
I never saw anything from Robert.  Did you get anything?  I didn't mean for this to end up on your plate.
 
How does closing look for tomorrow?  I don't want to redo the other 13 opinions until we know we are at the end.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay
