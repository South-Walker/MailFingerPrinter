Sasha --

I have a scheduling conflict tomorrow afternoon that will make it difficult 
to interview with Alisha at 2:30.  Mark Taylor has the 3:30 slot, and has 
graciously agreed to "swap" interview slots with me.  If you could you take 
Alisha to Mark's office at 2:30, Julia can bring Alisha by my office instead 
of Mark's at 3:30. 

Let me know if this creates a difficulty.  Thanks.
