Attached are drafts of the Electronic Trading Agreement, Password Application 
and Privacy Statement for ClickPaper.com.  These are based on the agreements 
currently in use by EnronOnline.  Greg and John, since they were prepared 
before our meeting with Mark this afternoon, minimal changes may be 
necessary, but I thought you might want to start looking at these.  Please 
call with any comments.
