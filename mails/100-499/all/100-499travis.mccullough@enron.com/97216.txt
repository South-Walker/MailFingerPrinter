The most current drafts of the Stockholders' Agreement, Common Stock Purchase Agreement and Warrant Agreement are attached.

Drew, these are cumulative redlines against the versions that we last sent to Kiodex, so they reflect more than just the comments that you gave me earlier today.

We would like to get these out to Kiodex on Thursday.  Please let Drew or I know if you have any comments.
