With respect to prosecuting our business method patent application outside the U.S., we may now designate those non-U.S. countries in which we are seeking patent protection, or elect to postpone that process for an additional ten months.
 
If we wish to designate the appropriate countries now, we must file an application in each country in which we want patent protection on or before February 28, 2002.   If we elect to postpone the process, we must file an notice to that effect on or before January 30, 2002.  One benefit of taking the ten-month extension of the process is that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office will review our patent application and issue a non-binding written opinion on whether our invention meets certain conditions (novelty, inventiveness, industrial applicability) that are required in order to be patentable.  
 
Please let me know whether we should designate countries now, or file for the extension.  It may be that we want to let the dust settle on the NETCO transaction before making this decision.
