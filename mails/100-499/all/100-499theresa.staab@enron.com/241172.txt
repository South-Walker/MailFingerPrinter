Gloria,
I was looking at Path Manager and it doesn't look to me like they even pathed this CAN point.  Let me know what you find out - Mark Bergeron at Woodward is expecting a call back from us (Paul Lucci) today.  
Thanks.

Theresa.

(The invoice they received must be based on nominations - right?)

Theresa - CIG just finaled their invoices today, and I am working on them.
I will take a look at this and get back with you.  Thanks, Gloria
