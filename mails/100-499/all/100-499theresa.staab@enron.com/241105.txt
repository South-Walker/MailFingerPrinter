Megan,
Here are the producers for November for the Powder River system.  I don't have Lost Creek yet - hopefully before you leave.

Please call me if you see any problems.

There will be no sales invoice this month for Crestone and I've told this to Scott Dozier.

I will get the gathering to Gloria tomorrow.

Thanks again,

Theresa

(P.S. - you'll have to give me your new # so we can keep in touch)
