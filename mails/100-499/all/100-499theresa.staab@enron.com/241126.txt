Megan,
I'm not sure why this is showing up.....I think it must have something to do with the name change from Enron Midstream to Crestone....

Let me pull out my Oct 00 file and see what invoice # we finalized then because I'm pretty sure they paid us.

I'll try and get to this later today.

Thanks,
Theresa

There is a sale to Crestone for Oct. 2000 that has not been finaled in Unify.  Does this need to be billed?  Megan
