Gee Thanks Barry!! 
 
You know I must say it's been a while since the Packers have had to worry about beating the Bears.  It's kind of fun to see an old rivalry back again.  The Bears are pretty good this year and if the game was in Green Bay I would really bet on the Packers but I'm just gonna hope they can beat them in Chicago.  I hope we'll get the game here in Denver.
 
GO PACK GO........
 
Do you care to wager anything?
