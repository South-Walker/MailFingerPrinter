Genaro,
BP is correct.  We needed the Btu conversion.  I have fixed the deal.  

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

Theresa,

The pricing for deal # 1020259 (buy from BP at Anschutz Plant) does not agree with the price invoiced by BP for Nov. 2001.  BP invoiced a rate of $2.5401. Sitara currently has IF NWPL Rockies + $.02 less $.09 (MCF conversion). Can you please review and advise?

Thanks,
Genaro
