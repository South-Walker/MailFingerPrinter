I'm glad.  I'm very sorry about that mix up.  Thank goodness we only have one more month of this deal and it expires.  We did not re-new it.

Talk to you later,
Theresa

Okay Guys -  Call me CRAZY!

I don't know what I did, but I had the wrong Gas Daily pricing in the spreadsheet for September.

Please accept my apology... One would have thought I'd have this down pat by now.

Sorry about this.  I hope this is the last revision for September.

Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
