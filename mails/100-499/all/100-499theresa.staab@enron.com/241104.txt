Kim,
Here's the PSCO website address.

Let me know if you have more questions.

Things are crazy for sure!  We are down to 3 employees here in Denver.  Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci and myself.

Talk to you soon,
Theresa

Do you have a web page or access to PSCO's tariff or rate information?

Let me know.

Thanks,
Kim

PS- how is everything going up there - this is totally crazy isn't it!
