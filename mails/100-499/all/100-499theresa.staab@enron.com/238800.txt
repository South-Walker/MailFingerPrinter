Mark,
I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  

I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.

I'll keep you posted.
