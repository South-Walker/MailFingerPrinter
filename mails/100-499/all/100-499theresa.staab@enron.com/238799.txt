I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a "paid invoices" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.

Have you heard anything about the rent check?  Let me know if you do not get an invoice from Todd for the remaining construction work.
 
Thanks
