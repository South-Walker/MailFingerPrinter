Vicky,
How are things going and how are you holding up?
I can't believe how crazy it sounds for you and the boys.

Please let me know if you need anything at all - I won't hesitate to help in any way!.


Did you get my box of presents?

I know you're busy so I'll keep this short.

We have our walk through tomorrow (Friday) and hopefully we can close early - Monday or Tuesday.  Otherwise we're scheduled to close on Thursday the 20th.  Everything looks good so far.   I believe our phones are getting hooked up on the 20th so I will finally have long distance service again.  

Our new address is 2264 E. 101st Ave., Thornton, CO  80229 and the phone # is (303) 450-1626.


Take Care and stay strong (I know you will - You are the strongest person I've seen!)

Please email me back and let me know how things are going and if you need anything!

Love,
Theresa
