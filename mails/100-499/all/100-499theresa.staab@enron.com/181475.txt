Position Manager is up to date for October 1 on Lost Creek.

We haven't heard back from EJW yet so there is no volume on the 002
contract right now.

North Central will be down about 10,000/d from the 1st - 2nd (which is
in the position), from the 3rd - 6th they'll increase by approx. 5,000
(in Position) and 7th - 31st up to estimated normal volumes (in
position).  For the 1st the 003 tickets are as follows:  LCW (WIC) is
#1063919 and LCK (CIG) is #1063952.  All volume is currently on WIC.

Devon is the 005 contract at 21,850.  TU #1063958 is LCW(WIC) and
#1063963 is LCK (CIG).  All volumes are on WIC currently.

We have no Fuel contract for October

The 004 is 2043 on WIC on ticket #1063851
