On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.
