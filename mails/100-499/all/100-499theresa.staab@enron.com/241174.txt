It's 10:10 our time and I didn't see the fax yet.  I wasn't sure what time you sent it.  

I have to take the kids to finish our shopping for the kids name drawing and we'll be done too.  We got Sierra an outfit from Old Navy - and I think she'll like it.

Talk to you soon.

Hi Theresa,
I just faxed 2 maps for you for you from the SF airport to our house.  Let me know if you get them ok. Any questions ask Dad this weekend.

We went shopping last night and found the Battleship game for Landon and our Old Navy store didn't have the pants in black with orange stripe so I got him gray with green stripe. We found a really cute outfit for Kayla at Mervyns. It's a beautiful blue velour pants set.  Now, I'm just waiting for the Bronco lamps to get here.  Penny's called the other day and said we should have them in 4-5 days.  I sure hope so!

Love,
Mom	PS:  I got you email on the air fare prices, I'll check later & see.
