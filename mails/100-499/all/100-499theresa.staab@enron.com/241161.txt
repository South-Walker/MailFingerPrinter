That was quick!.  You can bring it to work and we could meet for lunch one day.  Let me know which day is good for you.

Thanks,
Theresa

Theresa,

I got your Lloyds stuff in - let me know how I can get it to you.  If you
want, I can bring it in to work and maybe we can have lunch or something.  I
will be out on Friday, but any other day is fine.

Thanks,

Steph
