It probably won't be available until after the Holiday.   The reason I say that is because we haven't received the bill from Public Service yet. 

Are you out any time from now until the end of the month?

Do you know when the Citizens numbers will be ready for Oct. 2001?  I'm trying to get them billed before the holidays.

Thanks,
