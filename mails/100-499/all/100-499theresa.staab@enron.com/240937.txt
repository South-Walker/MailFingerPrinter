Hi Jeff,
I hope you get my message.  How are you doing?  How long will you be in the hospital in Germany?

I sent a package to your house with presents for the boys and some Western dressing for you.  I bet it will be there this week some time.  I sure hope things get better before Christmas!!!!!!!!

I'll keep my email short so you'll have time to read others since it doesn't seem like you get much time to use the internet.

We have our walk thru on our house Friday the 14th and can hopefully close on Monday or Tuesday the 17th or 18th.  I will be getting our phone hooked up on the 20th between 8:00 and 12:00 noon.  I can try and call you after that.  Joyce and Paul don't have long distance service for out of the country. 

Our new phone # is going to be (303) 450-1626 and our address is 2264 E. 101st Ave.

Take Care and DO EVERYTHING THE DOCTOR SAYS!  (I know how you can be :)  

Love,
Theresa
