Hi Tim,
Attached is a spreadsheet which contains Morgan Stanley's marks for our
positions with Enron in PV, Mead, and 4 Corners for Wednesday Nov 6th.  As I
mentioned in our phone conversation, we are trying to get to the bottom of a
$2mm mark discrepancy between our firms.  If you could drop in your marks for
Nov 6th in the spreadsheet and send it back to me, I would appreciate it.
Thanks again.

                                                            Joe Delaney
