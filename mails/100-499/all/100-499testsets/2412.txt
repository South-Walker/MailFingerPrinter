Congressional Republicans Draft Energy Bill to Aid the West=09\
Rep. Joe Barton has spliced together emergency legislation aimed at aiding =\
energy markets in the Western United States via funding for improvements in=\
 California's constrained transmission line SP-15 and directing federal dis=\
aster officials to prepare for power outages.  The move by Republicans came=\
 as Democratic criticism of the Bush administration's response to the Calif=\
ornia power crisis intensified Wednesday.  Although the bill will not conta=\
in the price caps sought by Democrats and a handful of Republicans, Barton =\
said he would allow amendments in support of price controls during committe=\
e deliberations.  A list circulated by GOP staff in recent weeks includes a=\
 range of ideas such as relaxing environmental rules, subject to a governor=\
's request; increasing federal energy assistance to low-income consumers; f=\
iring up mothballed power plants; and directing federal facilities to reduc=\
e energy use by 10%.  Additionally, the bill would grant governors the flex=\
ibility to allow power plants that have exceeded emissions limits to tempor=\
arily keep operating during emergencies.=09\
