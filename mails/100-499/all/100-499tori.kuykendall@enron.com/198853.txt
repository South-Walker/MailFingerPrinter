Hi.  I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the 
new day care center.  I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether 
or not we have been accepted.  I know the center doesn't open until 
September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line 
something up if I do not get in.  Also , do you know an exact date for the 
scheduled opening?  Thanks for your help.
