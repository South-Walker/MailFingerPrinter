river trip sounded like a blast!  the pool is going well - next step is the 
deck and they are starting this week -- realistically they could be done in 3 
weeks.  pat got a job  - thank goodness - he starts next thursday -- he'll be 
working downtown at waste management.  it was a pretty good offer -- good 
benefits -- good company -- he's going to be working for the old boss that he 
had at bank united.  we will be able to carpool now - no more bussing it for 
me -- also, we just found out today that we got into the new enron child care 
center -- that was a big relief.  so -- things continue to fall into place -- 
we're keeping our fingers crossed that it continues...
