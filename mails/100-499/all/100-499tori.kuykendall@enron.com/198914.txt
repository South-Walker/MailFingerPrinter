Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you 
haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been 
feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your 
life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out 
in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're 
expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see 
what's going on with you.  Write back if you can.
