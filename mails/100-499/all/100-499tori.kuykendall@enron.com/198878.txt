without trading experience, the jobs that you would be interviewing for would 
be risk analysis or scheduling probably.  i'm not sure how much you make but 
i think it may be a pay cut -- not sure though.  you can send me your resume 
though and i have alot of contacts in those areas - i'll do what i can.
