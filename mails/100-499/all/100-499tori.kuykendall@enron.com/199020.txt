sounds like a good plan -- i guess the best thing to do is follow advice of the experts -- hopefully we will win in the long run

Per Rick and Tom's advice, we made the following "BABY steps" back into the
market:
*	100 shares of TYC (their top stock) at 45ish and
*	We added 2K to each of Mutual funds.

This leaves us with 20K in the money market..
