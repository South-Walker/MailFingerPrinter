not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the 
birthdays simple.
