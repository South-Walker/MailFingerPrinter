Subject: Bunko Party


With most of the email responses back, the consensus is that there is no consensus.  Half of the people can make it on the 7th, and the other half can make it on the 14th.  Since we cannot get the majority of the people together, I suggest that we have a beginning of the New Year party with the significant others sometime in January.  Please let me know if this is OK with you. 


Thanks, 
Kim
