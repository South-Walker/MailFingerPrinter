Let me know if anything changes with the parental visit.  I'm sure we can
find another time.

You're right...it is rough out there on the job search front.  He's still
keeping a positive attitude though, so hopefully something will work out
soon.

I talked to Diane for a quick minute, and she said that she had a lot of
fun in Austin.  I miss Nicole!
