hey dan - it's tori from the good ole west gas desk.  i was talking to the 
klapper the other day and he said that i might be able to forward my hubby's 
resume to you to see if you knew of any good fits for his experience in your 
arena.  his background is in ecommerce account management/development and 
other IT consulting and auditing.  i'm gonna go ahead and attach his resume.  
please let me know if you think there's anything here for him - i would 
greatly appreciate the help.   
 
 
 
thanks,
 
tori
