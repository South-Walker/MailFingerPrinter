The 2 products will be EPNG Socal Ehrenberg and PG&E Topock.  The reason why 
we need to make these restricted products is so that we can prohibit El Paso 
Merchant Energy from trading them.  The reason why we want to do this is that 
El Paso Merchant Energy is refusing to trade with us, the Western region, 
both on their online trading system, ICE, and also in the broker market.  We 
feel that this is the appropriate action to take in order to keep the playing 
field level.  I'm sure this will bring up some questions, which should be 
directed to our VP, Mike Grigsby, if further explanation is needed.  Again, 
the desk has just made the decision to trade the products in this way, and 
they are asking me to make sure that we have the ability to roll them out on 
eol by 2/28 at the latest.  Thanks for your help.
