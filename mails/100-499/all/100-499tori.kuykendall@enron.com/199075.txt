Hi all,

We need to figure out how much we owe and to who now.  I think we all
agreed
we would not include food now, only the flowers, stuffed animals, cake and
stroller.

Tori, you mentioned to me you spent $65.00 on the cake, flowers and
animals.

Dana, can you please let us know the total for the stroller?  If you did
already I apologize.  I don't remember it.

I think Saturday went great...we all worked so well together and Jennifer
was very happy.  Cheers to us!

Thanks!
