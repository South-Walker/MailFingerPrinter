I'm so glad you wrote back.  Isn't the internet a wonderful thing?  I have 
been driving back and forth to the doctor and practically passing right by 
the house you grew up in.  I thought about you every time I drove by, and I 
had to find you.  Congratulations on your marriage.  Where did y'all meet?  
How's your family?  Gosh, I feel like asking you a million questions.  I 
can't believe I waited this long -- what has it been - like almost 10 years?  
That makes me feel old!  I guess I am turning 30 this year - scary thought!  
Anyway, I better get back to work, but I will call you - or - if I don't call 
first - my number is 281-578-9135.  
 
P.S. -- Do you remember Rachel Haygood?  She's still one of my closest 
friends and she says "HI."
