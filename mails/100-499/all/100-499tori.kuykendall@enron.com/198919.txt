WOW!  Congratulations on your engagement.  I remember you talking about her 
at the reunion.  I'm glad your career is going so well - as if there was ever 
a doubt.  Well, my news is also big.  I'm expecting a little girl on June 
11th.  Talk about a life changing event.  Pat and I moved to Katy to live 
close to my parents and to have a bigger and newer house.  I really love it 
there.  It's hard to believe our 6 year anniversary is coming up in March.  
I'm still working at Enron - still trading commodities, and it's going really 
well.  Like I said before, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday and 
catch up a little.  I know how busy you are, but I'd love to have your new 
email when you leave Seattle.  Until next time - take care and have fun 
planning the wedding!
