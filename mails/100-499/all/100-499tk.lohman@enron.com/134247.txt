FYI!

TW Operations have been running pigs from Station 9 to P1 and from P1 to P2.  176 barrels of water have been received at P2.  Large amounts of water are beginning to show at P3.  The field has planned to run pigs from P2 to P3 today or tomorrow.  Owens Corning is on this leg between P2 and P3 and because of the large amounts of water they may be shut in for one day.  This POI pulls 3,200 mmbtu/day and TW is working with Owens.  Entergas may serve them for one day.
