No, I was not okay with this, but I have gotten with Ramona on the changes.  Maria Pavlou has stated that she is okay with leaving the Points on the Mojave and Topock laterals in the WOT area instead of E of Cal.  On Elizabeth's list this would include SWG Mojave and Calpine.

Be advised that we are trying to define all points that should be included in the East of California grouping for nomination/capacity release purposes on firm contracts.  The attached list has been filtered to include all points that are valid for transport.  Please confirm the list to make sure that:  1) we have not erroneously included/excluded points; and 2) that there are no issues for nominations, allocations or billing.

Please send a quick email response if corrections are necessary.

Thanks,
Elizabeth
