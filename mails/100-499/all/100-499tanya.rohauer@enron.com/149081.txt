I doubt it as I do not believe any margin calls have been made since our filing; Monica should confirm this.  Unfortunately, we do not have clarity on the valuations, thus we do not know if we are truly entitled to continue to hold the LCs. We can always call for a renewal assuming the same exposures and wait for them to dispute it.

The LC's that have been posted to us by El Paso, LG&E and Niagra Mohawk have language that permits us to draw if we have made a request for alternate security, none has been provided and fewer than 20 days are left prior to expiration.  Was this done?
