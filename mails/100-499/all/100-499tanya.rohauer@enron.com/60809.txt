Louise and Bill,\
\
As you are aware, NBC has sent us notification of an event of default under=\
 the ISDA due to our failure to post collateral (in the form of an LC).  To=\
 date, NBC has resisted all of our commercial solutions to this issue.  At =\
the close of business today, our cure period for the event of default will =\
expire, and NBC will be able to draw on the $1.4MM LC posted and terminate =\
the contract. Today we have seen a bit of movement in their position.  They=\
 are now willing to accept cash as collateral if Enron will agree to reduce=\
 its collateral threshold to some agreed upon amount.  Bill Bonnell, their =\
credit manager, has suggested $4MM as the appropriate level. This would ent=\
ail Enron posting $3MM in addition to the $500K collateral call for a total=\
 of $3.5MM.  I believe we could more than likely negotiate the threshold to=\
 $5MM if we are willing to post the cash.  A $5MM level would require an ad=\
ditional posting of $2MM which is what we originally forecasted to try to b=\
uy down the position exposure.  As we must have a resolution today to fores=\
tall further action on the part of NBC, please advise as to management's wi=\
llingness to use cash for the purpose of preventing termination of this con=\
tract.\
