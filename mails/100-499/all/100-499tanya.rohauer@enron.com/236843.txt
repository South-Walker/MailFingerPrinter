This is my stab at the very complicated Duke relationship.  Please call with questions.  Janna Blanter at Duke should validate this list as well.  Call with questions.  The guaranties are a disaster because some of these are gtd by Duke Capital, others stand on their own or currently have an intermediate guarantor.  We should think about one all encompassing gty from Enron Corp and Duke Capital to simplify things.
