What are your thoughts on terminations of ISDAs that are really late? for example, the new york times declared 1/25/02 as the termination date, citing the bankruptcy which was 12/2/01.  While newprint valuations may not have moved very much due to the low volatility, what about companies who have other products?  They can just be waiting until the marks are in their favor to terminate.  Is there any way to prevent and how are we handling, if at all?
