 
One more time... can you explain the difference between assignment and 
novation?  We expected them to assign all of the BT trades to DB didn't we?

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want
to do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't
thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like
on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full
novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until
we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers
Trust financial trades and master sit.
