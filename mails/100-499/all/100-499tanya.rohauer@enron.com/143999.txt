The only change from our previous conversation is the addition of a bilateral 
additional event of default tied to a debt rating (below BBB-) of the 
counterparty or the guarantor if applicable.

Guarantors:
1. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
2. not required; entity rated AA
3. not requried; entity rated AA
4. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.
5. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
6. not required; entity rated AA

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya
