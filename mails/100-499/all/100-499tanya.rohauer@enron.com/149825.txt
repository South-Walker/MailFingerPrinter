Other than rate or currency, what else do we use these Enron Corp masters for (I seem to recall used for Enron stock stuff)? Who would I contact and be able to get details on the transactions from? Someone in Corp? Thanks!!

Is there a way to find out what deals exist, if any, under Enron Corp ISDAs?
