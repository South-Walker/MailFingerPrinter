I think this works for covering ENA for any HPL breach; however, I'd like to 
see explicit language that requires HPL to make ENA whole in the event the 
counterparty does not pay ENA.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya,
 Please review the attached document regarding our conversation concerning 
the back to back arrangement.  I believe the highlited information should 
cover your concerns and it is the same information as was used in the CES 
documents.  Please advise if anything further is needed.
