Mark,

Can one of the paralegals in your group resume sending out the executed list 
of masters on a monthly basis?  I think Susan Flynn had been doing this in 
the past.  Considering the rapid pace at which we are executing documents, it 
would be very helpful for us if we could resume distribution.  Thanks!
