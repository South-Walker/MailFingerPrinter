My compensation is directly affected by the success of EBS - go figure!  To 
be fair, I am also facilitating a significant number of ISDAs which of course 
are my first love.  If you are looking for unbiased, Bill may be your best 
bet as he is probably indifferent between ENA, EPMI, EBS, EES, etc as his 
compensation is affected by all of them!!

I could not believe my ears when I heard from Ms. Heard that you are working 
covertly behind the scenes to ensure a Broadband win to the signed master 
competition.   I would think that Credit would have no biased interest in the 
outcome of this race.  Could such slanderous allegations be true?
