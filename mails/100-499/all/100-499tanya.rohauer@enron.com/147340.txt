1. We should not have a threshold for these transactions - only KCS
2. Do we need to reference that the Master has been amended in the opening 
paragraph
3. Is there any way to reference the assignment to Brazos?  I just want to 
make sure everyone understands that there are two outcomes for these deals on 
Jun 15:  1) Termination if VPP not done or 2) assignment of swap to Brazos if 
VPP is done.  There should never be a time where ENA has a trades with KCS 
beyond Jun 15.

Thanks,
Tanya
