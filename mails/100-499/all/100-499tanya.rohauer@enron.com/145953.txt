Don't have any recollection...but my CAS records do show that we are using 
the old SBC master.

Tanya:

I have been reviewing some of Gary Hickerson's older master agreements which 
may require amending (to provide for multibranch transactions).  I wanted to 
verify which master we are relying on for UBS AG.  The files are a little 
confusing but it appears that we use the May 31, 1993  Swiss Bank Corporation 
master (and not the March 15, 1994 master with Union Bank of Switzerland).

Do you have any recollection of this?
