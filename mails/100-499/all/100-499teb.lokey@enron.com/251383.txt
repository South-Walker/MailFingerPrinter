Subject: American History lesson
>
>It was the first day of school and a new student named Suzuki, the son
>of a Japanese businessman, entered the fourth grade in an american
>school.
>
>The teacher said, "Let's begin by reviewing some American history. Who
>said "Give me Liberty, or give me Death?" She saw a sea of blank faces,
>except for Suzuki, "Patrick Henry, 1775." He said.
>
>"Very good! Who said 'Government of the people, by the people, for the
>people, shall not perish from the earth'?"
>
>Again, no response except from Suzuki:
>
>"Abraham Lincoln, 1863.", said Suzuki
>
>The teacher snapped at the class, "Class, you should be ashamed. Suzuki,
>who is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do."
>She heard a loud whisper: "Screw the Japs."
>
>"Who said that?" she demanded.
>Suzuki put his hand up.
>"Lee Iacocca, 1982."
>Now furious, another student yells, "Oh yeah? Suck this!" Suzuki jumps
>out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, "Bill
>Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!"
>
>The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around
>the teacher on the floor, someone said, "Oh shit, we're in BIG trouble!"
>and Suzuki said,
>"Arthur Andersen, 2002."
