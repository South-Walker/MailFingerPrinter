I think we need to update tariff sheets explaining the contract has terminated.

Teb,

In talking with Michelle Brown about billing the Conoco contract, she was wondering if we needed to changed the tariff rate sheets for the Current Firm Customers.  I believe I copied you on the Conoco contract e:mail on the TCR II surcharges.  I was thinking (before talking with Michelle) that we really did not have to change those tariff sheets (5B.02 and 5B.03); however, I am not so sure anymore.  The CFC rates on 5B.02 do not apply to Conoco anymore.  So do we need to take them off?  There is a note on 5B.02 that says the surcharges on 5B.03 (TCR II) are applicable to the CFCs listed on 5B.02.

So my question:  Do we just leave the tariff sheets alone, since Conoco's contracts under the Global and Mini- Settlements have terminated, or do we need to update this sheets?

I do not think this is urgent, but I wanted to ask.

Jeanette
