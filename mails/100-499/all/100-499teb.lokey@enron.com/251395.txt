It looks like we decide on a case by case basis whether to process pre-4/97 ppas.

Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule. -- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas.  I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept.
