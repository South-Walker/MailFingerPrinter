Kim gave this e-mail address to Debbie who forwarded it to me.  Just checking in to let you know you and your family are in our thoughts and prayers.  We are happy you have arrived - things must be going fairly smoothly.  I'm thinking that its a good thing that you got all of the negative experiences out of the way before your trip.  Everything can go well from now on.  I'm sure Kim and Chad will be glad when their ladies return from their adventure and things can get back to just the usual crises.  Rob, Steve, Blair, Christi, and Zelda all send their prayers and best wishes - I'm assuming Debbie will send you an e-mail also (she is off today).  Stay warm and safe  and come back soon!  --  Teb
