Thank you for all of the help and inspiration you have given us these many years.  I will miss you very much but am very happy for your new opportunity - it is well deserved.  (My now ex-wife) Sandy was very grateful for the help you gave her, and still asks about you when the subject of the Body Shop comes up.  

Where is your new fitness center?  We may have to come by and check it out.

God bless you each day.  Keep your positive attitude and you will be blessed.
