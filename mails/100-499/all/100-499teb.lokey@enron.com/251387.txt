Rob and Teb,
If you would like, I will work on this Thursday and finish next week if necessary.  We already have several put together from the change-over from NNG.

EY has requested copies of all FERC orders issued in 2000 and 2001 for their external review of TW's financial statements. Could you provide to me, some time next week?

Thanks for your help!
