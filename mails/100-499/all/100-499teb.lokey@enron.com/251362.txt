We need to use FGT's filing as a guide to determine which parts of TW's tariff need to be changed.  

Debbie,  Can you work with Jeanette and Bill Rapp to see what needs to be done?  Thanks,  Teb

Teb,
I talked with Dennis a little bit about this.  (Dennis, we currently have electronic contracting for capacity release only).  We have language in TW's tariff for electronic contracting for capacity release on Sheet No. 72B. 

Let me know what you want to do and if we want to duplicate the Florida language.

Jeanette

Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system.  In preparation for implementation of the new system, we need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow the option of Electronic Contracting the same way we did to FGT's tariff when we implemented their new system.  

The new contract system is scheduled to go into production Q1, 2002.

Teb, do we need a meeting, or can you proceed?

Let me know.
