HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!! 

I hope you'll take some time for yourself today and indulge in something
extra special. I'll be wearing a new crown a little later--but not the kind
you put on your head! It's COLD here but is supposed to reach the high
20s/low 30s. All kitties are inside, curled up in a warm spot. I bet yours
are doing the same, since your weather has been so heavenly.

Love and hugs,
Sandy
