Keri - I would like to add my nephew, of whom I have legal custody, to my membership at the Met - or Downtown Club.  His name is Michael Anthony Orona.  He is 17 years old, and will turn 18 next Wednesday, January 31.  (He was born 1/31/83.)  As I stated, I have legal custody of Anthony, I am raising him as if he were my son, and he is included in all of my Enron benefits.  I have papers from a court of law awarding me custody, with the full consent of both of his parents who are unable to care for him.  His address is the same as mine - 507 Welch, Houston, TX 77006.  He is a senior at Lamar High School and very active in school and extracurricular activities - including sports.

I hope the rules will permit Anthony's addition to my membership as I have been raising him as a son for several years.  Please call me at 713-853-6868 if you have any questions or require additional information. 

Thank you for your consideration.
