Audrey - Could you please help me schedule a meeting with the TW Commercial Team and Teb Lokey and Rob Kilmer?  It will be to discuss the procedure to allow FT shippers to change primary points and will not last more than one hour.  Teb and Rob are both necessary as well a majority of the Commercial group.  I'm available anytime except 9:30 tomorrow and 3:00 - 3:30 Friday.  Thanks.  

Lorraine
