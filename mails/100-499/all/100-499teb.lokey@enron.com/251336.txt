Just talked to Debbie and she told me about the 2 week waiting period after the proceeding you are trying to get waived.  However it turns out, the end is in sight.  Everyone is still keeping you, Alina, Kim and Chad in their thoughts and prayers.  We can't wait to meet Alina in person, hopefully sometime shortly after the first of the year you can bring her up.  If she needs time to get acclimated before encountering downtown Houston and meeting new people we will understand.  I hope your various ailments are healed, or at least getting better.  Debbie talks to your Mom and Kim periodically, but we enjoy your e-mails when you get a chance.  Hang in there and you will soon be back telling many stories of your adventure.  --  Teb
