Haven't heard anything from Shelley.  I think she had business plan meetings this pm.
  I will reschedule when I hear from her.

Teb,

	Have you heard anything back from Shelly? If she is available, what time will the meeting start since the TW staff meeting has been cancelled?

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.
