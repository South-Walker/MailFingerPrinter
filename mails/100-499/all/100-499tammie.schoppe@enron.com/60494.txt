Subject:	Business Cards for Newco Employees

Tammie -- Happy New Year.  I am preparing a plan for designing/printing collateral materials (stationary, envelopes, etc.) for Newco since we will need to do a big mailing announcing the new trading web site. 

It occured to me that Newco employees will want new business cards as well.  Is the buyer going to handle printing business cards for us?  If not, I can help mock up some designs and talk to some printers about getting them printed quickly.  My thought was that we send out an e-mail to employees (around Jan 14th) with an order form where employees can put in their business card info. and submit to me.  Our group can collect all the orders and hire a printer to do one mass business card print run.  This will save money and create a consistent look for business cards.  When you can, pls. let me know what you think.

Thanks

Kal
