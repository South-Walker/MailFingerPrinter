I have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday October 18 at 1:30 p.m. 
central time to discuss our strategy relating to the CPUC investigation.  The 
dial in number is 1-800-998-2462 (pincode 4699545)

The rough agenda is as follows:

1. Update on conversations with CPUC attorneys (Fergus and Day)
2. Update on status of other companies' responses to CPUC subpoena
3. Update on compilation of trading data to be provided to CPUC (Fergus, 
Yoder, Hain, Smith, Aamodt)
4. Legal analysis regarding Enron's objection to specific requests and to 
CPUC jurisdiction (Day, Fergus, Watkiss)
5. Assignment of tasks to be accomplished
