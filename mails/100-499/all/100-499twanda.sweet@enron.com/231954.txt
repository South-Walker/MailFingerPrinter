Please be advised that as of this moment there will not be a conference call 
for this Friday, June 16th.  I will notify everyone via email when a call is 
set for sure. I will also give you the pincode for that call (which will be 
the same as last Friday - dial in 800-998-2462 pincode 4309724).

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks
