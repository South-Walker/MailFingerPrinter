As outlined in Mark Haedicke's voicemail to you, I have attached a draft 
response to Long Island Power's letter.  We are attempting to obtain a 
release from LIPA of any claim related to the terminated transaction.  As a 
result, I would recommend that we hold off sending this letter until the 
release has been negotiated, which should be by Thursday, March 15th.  Please 
call me if you have any questions.
