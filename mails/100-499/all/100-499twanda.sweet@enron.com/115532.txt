I am in the process of scheduling a meeting in Portland on Tuesday, October 3 
and Wednesday, October 4 (morning).  Richard Sanders would like to know if 
you are available to participate.  The participants are as follows:

Jim Steffes
Christian Yoder
Mary Hain
Gary Fergus (?sp)

Richard's plan is to leave for Portland on Monday around 8:30 pm.  Have 
meeting in Portland on Tuesday (most of the day), and Wednesday (morning), 
then return to Houston on 3:00 flight or maybe earlier.

Can you please let me know if you will be available to participate?

Thanks.
