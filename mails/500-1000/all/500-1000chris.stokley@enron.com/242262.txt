Thanks Chris, I am really hoping to have all of the audit plan
correspondence completed by Wednesday because I am taking three weeks off of
work.  So, I would really appreciate it if you could get the audit plan to
me as soon as possible.  Thanks for getting back to me and let me know if
you have any other questions or hold up.  Thanks again.

		Jeanette,
			Sorry I am so late in getting back w/ you on this
topic. We had
		a mix up w/ AA that had to get worked out but I think we are
clear to go
		forward. I have the Audit Plan from AA so I will give them
my comments
		and send it to you by tomorrow.
