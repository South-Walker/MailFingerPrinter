Stewart,

	I went over Murray's spreadsheet for the CDWR allocation and found some numbers that don't make since to me. I will talk to Murray the moment he walks in the door and get this e-mail to CDWR before 9:00am. There is an adjustment made to the multiplier for CDWR that is specific to only them as a counterparty.
