Awsome! That is very cool, she will also help put things into perspective for you along the way. I will be swinging  by your floor sometime after 5:00 today, I will drop in if you are there. Thanks for the update.

Chris,

I couldn't remember if I sent you an email or not.  So I am going back and doing it.  On June 22 my daughter Elizabeth was born.  7 lbs 6 oz, 19.5 inches.  She is a handful.

I never knew how much I liked sleep before she came.  She already has Dad wrapped around her finger.  Hope all is well.

Greg
