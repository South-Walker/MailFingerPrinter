Gang,\
I was out of the office from Friday morning until Wednesday morning. I trie=\
d to check my voice mail during that time period but was unable to do so b/=\
c of a problem due my moving to a new location on Friday. I just now got ac=\
cess to my voice mail which was full of messages of you guys trying to reac=\
h me for a conference call. My apologies for this mishap, please feel free =\
to call me in the future on my cell at 503-807-8959. If you do not get a re=\
turn phone call within a few hours, contact Mary Vasquez at 5-6349. My cell=\
 is Portland based and has a tendency to lose messages or give them to me i=\
n an untimely manner. As far as the issue at hand, I completed the ExPost p=\
ricing last week and would be more than happy to go over it w/ whoever is a=\
vailable. Please get w/ Mary and have here set up a schedule for us to meet=\
 tomorrow at what ever opening I have in my schedule. Once again, I am sorr=\
y for the late response to such an urgent matter. I can also be reached at =\
my home number on the weekend which is 503-625-3541.\
