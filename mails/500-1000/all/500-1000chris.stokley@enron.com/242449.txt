Subject: MDMA/MSP Reports


Greetings, I just wanted to send an update to all of you regarding the
MDMA/MSP audit reviews that PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E (the UDC's) agreed to
conduct.  I was told that all three UDC's have completed these reviews.
Below is a list of contact information for you to request a copy of the
report(s).  It is my understanding that the UDC's are not sending out copies
unless they receive a request.  So, please contact the people listed below
in order to obtain a copy of the MDMA/MSP reports to review and submit with
your audit reports due to the ISO on September 28, 2001.
