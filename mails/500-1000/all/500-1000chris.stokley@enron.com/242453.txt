Jo Ellen,

	The document below should be a starting point for our discussion this afternoon. I should give you a pretty good idea of the variables we are trying to capture in the Deal Ticket. I will be speaking w/ Steve Walker this afternoon to flush this all out in  greater detail. If you have any question please call me at 503-807-8959.
