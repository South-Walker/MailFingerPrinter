Steve,

	I will be in meeting most of the morning but have an open schedule after 12:30 today. Would 1:00 be a good time for us to discuss any pending items that we have left to complete? Could you please send me a list of the hot items so that I can research them before our meeting.


							Thanks for your patience
							          Chris
