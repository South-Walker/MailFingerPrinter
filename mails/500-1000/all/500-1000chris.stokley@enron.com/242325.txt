Chris,

You have several new users starting soon. Do you want me to mirror them after a specific user?  If not could you please get with me so I can request the appropriate access for each person.  I have already requested the default user accounts..  login ID's and Notes.

Kit Blair  Id - kblair   pswd   
Marina Tchernokojeva - Id mtcherno  
Eugene Lee - Id - elee2 

Login password:  p0rt8lan!  (it's a zero not an o)  (same for all users)
Notes Password: notespassword!  (same for all users)

Thanks,
Diana Willigerod
