Audrey,

Here are the Income Statements I've created using Courtney's data to pay Willamette. I'll be gone on vacation this afternoon thru Monday. 
Willamette is getting upset that we haven't settled for 6 months after the power flowed. I need to get them paid for these months this week if possible.

Les
