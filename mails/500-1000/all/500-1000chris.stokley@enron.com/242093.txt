Hi Chris, your public folder has been created. you can access it by clicking on the public folder/all public folders/other enron entities/enron north america/portland and then you can click on the folder with your name on it. You can find this directory in Outlook under the folder list. Give me a call if you need any help with this 503-703-0536        talk to you later Chris,  Chip
