Ken,
	Murray is going to take a look at the responses before his 10:30 meeting at which time I will forward those over to you. Also, I am going to have Patti set up a time for you and I to meet on Thursday.

Ken,

	First of all, sorry for the mix up last week that is all on me. As far as the comment on the SQMD, Murray wants to take a look at the responses which should happen this morning or early afternoon. I would also like to schedule some time this week to sit down and talk about some questions that I have about the audit that fall outside of my responses. Once again I  apologize for the delay and I will have something to you ASAP.
