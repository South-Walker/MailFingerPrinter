I just talked to the developer and the MV90 and MDMA data sinks up daily.  The previous day's
read should be available in MDMA the next day.  I haven't asked for a logon and password to get
into MV90 because I am not sure you would want the data from MV90.  From my understanding,
MV90 will hold the raw usage and it does not get validated for high low checks or other errors until it gets to MDMA.

If the previous day's data is sufficient then MDMA should be good enough.

Let me know if you still need me to pursue further.

Vivian,
	Have you heard anything back on the time in which they sink up MV90 and MDMA. Also, were you able to find out the password to get into MV90 just in case we have  to go straight to the source. Thanks again for all of your help on these issues.
