Steve,
	I have heard nothing on my end about the status of the update meeting. I will update you the moment I hear something. I have not spoken to Paige as of this morning. I will track her down and reschedule this meeting and give you an update on the new time.

Have you heard if the update meeting was cancelled for this week or will be rescheduled?  If there still is a meeting this week we need to finish the update slides.  Did you get with Paige Grumulaitis or are you going to reschedule.  Let me know when you get a chance.
