Andy,
	That is 30 out of a total of 100 if I understood you correctly. Are the other 70 just the straight commodity deals? Thanks for your help on this item.

Chris--

The file attached below lists all the Project Phoenix deals.  I believe that all GNO deals (approximately 30 of them) are covered.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Thanks,

Andy
