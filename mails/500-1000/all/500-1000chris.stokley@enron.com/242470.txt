Thanks for reminding me. Let me check today and see if I can find the title of the book that I am looking for.

Chris,

Hope you had a good weekend!  Wanted to check and see if there were any books that you wanted me to pick up at Borders on Wednesday (the day we have the discount).  Let me know and I'd be happy to do it for you.
