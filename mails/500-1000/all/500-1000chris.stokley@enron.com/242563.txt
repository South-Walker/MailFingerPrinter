Murray and Chris, we made good progress last week on the approach that best meets the Everest kick off and as likely coordinates most effectively across the impacted groups.  I'd like to get with you to review status and explore more carefully impact / interactions on your other activities.  I've just started talking carefully with Vivian and Neal, to resume tomorrow afternoon.  Can you suggest a time when we could meet?  Thanks.

Glenn
