Yes, we do have Outlook. Get w/ Monica, I currently have her on my MSN IM. How is that Spanish coming along, can I now bring you along as an interpreter on my next trip to South America? Also, you need to come up w/ an excuse for  coming over to Houston in the very near future.

Chris,

Enron Europe has restricted access to MSN Messenger to communicate through the web. It is possible to set it up if you have MS Outlook.  Have you guys been migrated to MS Outlook?  Anyway, how is everything?

Cheers
