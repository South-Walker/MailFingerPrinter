Chris,

We have contacted Pat Priestley regarding obtaining the following data for the ISO audit.

We requested two sets of data.  One set which includes daily detail source data from a sample of meters before the application of distribution loss factors and load profiles, and a second set which includes the daily detail meter data that is summed within the SQMD file.  

For each UDC we requested data from 2 meters from each rate class (1 actual meter and 1 estimated meter).  In addition we requested 5 Enron meters from each UDC from different rate classes. The meter data should be taken from 2/15/00, 6/11/00, 7/15/00, 8/7/00, 12/28/00, respectively.

Pat has notified us that a WIP is required in order for us to obtain this data, please confirm if this is the case.

Regards,

Ken
