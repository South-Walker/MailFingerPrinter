Chris,

I just wanted to take a moment to let you know what a great job Kit is doing.  He is energetic, inquisitive and consistently takes the necessary initiative to get the job done.

He asks all of the right questions, especially "why?," which inspires me to tune up my own knowledge and skills.  It is refreshing to have someone like him join the group and I anticipate that he'll be able to handle allocations completely by the end of next week.

Thank you for your foresight and for the help.

Donna
