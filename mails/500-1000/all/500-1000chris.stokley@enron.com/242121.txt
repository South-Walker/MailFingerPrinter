Diann,

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

Vivian has regained access to the MDMA.    However, I need to control who has access so that we don't interfere with CSC's operation.  Let me know who will need access to this data.  Thanks.
