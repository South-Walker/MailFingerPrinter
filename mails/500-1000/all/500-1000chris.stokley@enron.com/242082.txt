I made some changes to the requirements after meeting with Rogers yesterday.  I plan to send this out to IT today - of course, that does not mean this is set in stone.  Let me know if you want me to wait and/or if you have any changes to incorporate.

Also, here is my first cut at the intramonth deal entry screen (part of short-term solution hooked into RPS).  Let me know if you have any comments/questions.
