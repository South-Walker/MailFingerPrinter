James,
	Could you send the presentation that was presented by Load Star to myself and Murray? I think you said that  you had a copy of the presentation. 

							Thanks

James, 

I am not 100% sure I can provide answers to all of the gas questions below.  I am in the process of locating the correct CSC/EES personal for this data.

I will contact you as soon as I have some answers.

Details regarding EES/CSC deal capture and billing for 90/110 consumption bands -

Power

EWS Business Contact - Richard Miller
Deal Capture Status - Information is not included on any CSC power deal tickets (deal sheets)
Risk Book Status - Currently not captured - A.K. Matheson is researching and will provide details
Billing Status - CSC does not know which customers bands apply to - currently not applying to any power customer bills

Gas

EWS Business Contact - Lisa McClendon
Deal Capture Status - Information is included on CSC gas deal tickets (deal sheets)
Risk Book Status - Currently captured
Billing Status - CSC does know which customers bands apply to - currently applying bands to some gas customer bills, but process performed manually
	==>  Lisa has been working with CSC this week to determine the following -
		- How many gas deals do bands apply to?
		- How is CSC tracking penalties by meter and by billing period?
		- What is total $ amount of penalties?
		- What is the estimated unbilled penalty amount and what is CSC's plan to resolve on a go-forward basis?

I will forward additional information as it becomes available.

Thanks,
James
