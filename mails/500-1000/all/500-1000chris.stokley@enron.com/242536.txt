Both, I would like to have a complete understanding of what MSAL will provide upon completion. Also, I would like to set up a meeting with you sometime tomorrow to get your input on some of the issues I am running into on the lack of a given baseline in most of the contracts that the KPMG group are going through. Thanks for your help on these items.

Chris, I know you asked me for some information related to the MSAL after our staff meeting yesterday.  Exactly what do you want to see?  A process flow or the data points we are considering for the system.  Please advise so I know better what to provide.  Thanks
