Wayne,
	What do think of the latest re-org and the e-mail we got from Derenda. Do you have any insight into what is going on over in the EES world. It looks like I will be on the team that helps sort all of this out and I wanted to see if you had any knowledge on Don Black. Also, who is the gentleman that caused you and Derenda so much grief? I guess this all worked out well for you in the end, since you won't have to sweat all of the decisions that are about to take place for that area of the business. I more than likely will be in Houston quite a bit over the next 6mts, so I will swing by and visit with you and Chad when I find out my schedule. Hope all is going well, Derenda told me that you were enjoying your job.



							Chris
