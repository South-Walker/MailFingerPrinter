Kristian,

	I met with Tim today to inform him of my intentions to pursue opportunities outside of the Portland office. It seem to go very well, w/ TIm also saying that he had expressed an interest in working in London. He did make sure and state that the London office is the highest cost office in all of Enron, and therefore would probably be the first on to experience layoffs if the economy took a downturn. His thought is that he wants to see if he can get me into something on the floor by mid year, but would support me if I decide to go elsewhere. The tougher issue is going to be telling Murray of my intentions. What do I do now to start truly pursuing a job in the London office?
