Kevin,
	No problem, just let me know if there is anything that I could do on my side. I am in town this week but I am not sure of my schedule yet. When I nail it down I will give you and Chad a call.

Chris,
	Thanks for the help in the "keeping a job" matter.  I appreciate it and will let you know what happens.  Hopefully things will be OK here.  Stop by next time you're here and we can go get a good steak somewhere.  Are you back next week?
Kevin
