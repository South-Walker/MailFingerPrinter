Mechelle,

	Sorry for the delay on getting you the documents in question. I currently can not get into Lotus Notes where all of the documents reside. The IT group is looking into the problem and I will get the documents to you the moment that I have access to Lotus Notes again.

Hello, Chris.  It was nice to meet you last Friday.  I wanted to remind you to please re-email me those documents as soon as you get a chance.  I'd like to get through those and have a plan re:  dates, staff, etc. by mid-week this week.  Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks.
