I think I am only getting billed through Sept., but I will check. As far as the car goes, I am fine w/ just using a cab and I will continue staying at an apartment in Mid-Town(Under someone else's name).


					Thanks

Tell me about the HomeCorp room(s).  I just got a bill for Oct. under Steve Swain's name, but HomeCorp said that there is no longer an apartment in your name.  Did you just move into the other apartment, or do I need to start booking you a hotel room?  Also, do you need a car at this point, or is a cab still working ok?

Chris,

You have no travel arranged after this week.  If you'll send me your travel dates I'll get something on the books for you.
