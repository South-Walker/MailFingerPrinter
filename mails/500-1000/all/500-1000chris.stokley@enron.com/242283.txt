Subject:	California ISO Responsibilities

Good morning all, 

I just wanted to clarify the distribution of some of the California responsibilities...

Godfrey Hyde will be handling all of Audrey's old accounts with the exception of the California ISO and its related customers, such as those below, that are handled outside of the Enpower/Unify systems.
I will be training our new coordinator, Sharon Fredrick, on the ISO process and she will be responsible for this portion until Audrey's return.  Please ensure that all communication regarding the ISO is sent to both Sharon and myself.

Please join me in welcoming Sharon to the group, and feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thank you, Melissa

Subject:	Revision - Snohomish Final Actualization - September 2000 ISO

Godfrey,

I have revised the Snohomish number, as we had a counter party called SNO that actually belongs to Snohomish.  I am inserting a new table with the corrected amount (they still owe us money, it's just more money).

Subject:	Final Actualization - September 2000 ISO

Godfrey,

The final actualizations for Preliminary and Final Settlements are available and can be found in the following Flash file:

M:\\Electric\\CALISO ACTUALIZATION\\Actual\\2000\\Final\\0900 Settlements Final ISO 042701.xls

The following customers have been paid an initial amount, and are owed the additional amount as shown:



You will note that Snohomish was overpaid, and owes us a refund in the amount of $1,591.06; the remaining amounts are balances owed to the customer.   I can find no record of an initial payment to El Paso (EPE), but the Flash report reflects a payment owed to them.  Other customers reflected in the Flash are handled in a different manner and we need to talk about those (CRC, DELANO, HARBOR, Willamette, etc.).  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions about this data, or the details in the Flash file, as well as to discuss the special-handling customers.

Please set up these payments to go out as quickly as possible, and let me know the expected payment date.

Thanks,

Caroline
