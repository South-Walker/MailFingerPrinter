	Two items that I need addressed ASAP
1)	I need to get the analyses mentioned below by the close of business today.
2)	I need to get the new meter data files for 3/17/01- 3/23/01 immediately along w/ the analysis of the MW differences b/w what was originally submitted and the latest submittal to the ISO.

Pat,
	Just a reminder that I will need the MW diff/ for all of the days in question before I can resubmit the March activity to the ISO.
