Who has the scoop on the ski trip? Spending a lot of time in Houston working on the EES project, what a  mess. As far as the TX market, I am not currently involved in that area but will probably start looking at in within the next month. What is a QSE? So what are you currently working on for Reliant, and how do you like the work and culture so far. We need to go have lunch since I am in Houston damn near every week. Great to hear from you, and I hope that everything is going well for you.

I'm just now hearing some juicy stuff from your annual ski trip from 2000.
I said I would have paid to see IT.

How's it going?  Are you guys involved in the Texas market?  Are you a QSE?

call me at work some time.   713-207-3275
