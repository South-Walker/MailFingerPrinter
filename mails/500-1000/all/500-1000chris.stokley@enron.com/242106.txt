Diann,

	We have a few paths that we are looking into, including the one that we discussed w/ Maurice. Never at any time in that meeting did we decide not to look at the paths listed below. Does this mean that you have done nothing to facilitate these request to CSC?

Chris,  I thought that you and Michael met with Maurice the other day and decided a slightly different path.  Is that not the case?

Diann,

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

Vivian has regained access to the MDMA.    However, I need to control who has access so that we don't interfere with CSC's operation.  Let me know who will need access to this data.  Thanks.
