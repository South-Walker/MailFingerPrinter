Vivian,

	I just wanted to leave you my contact numbers:
	
						Cell:    503-807-8959
					           Work:   503-464-8219
 					          Home:   503-625-3541

	I will be flying out tomorrow, but I should be in around 1:00 Pacific Time. Please send me an e-mail on where we stand with being able to get into the MV90 tables. I have Jeff Richter chomping at the bit on this one so it would be a nice if we can get our hands on that data. Thank you very much for your help on this topic.
