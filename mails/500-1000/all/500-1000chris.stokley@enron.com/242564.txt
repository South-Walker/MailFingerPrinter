I just talked with Dan Rothfuss of CG&E and it looks like Tuesday, October 23 will work out best for a meeting in Cincinnati for CG&E to walk us through their standard supplier presentation and for us to ask whatever detailed questions we may have.  

The link below will take you to the powerpoint presentation they will walk us through.  Please let me know asap if you have other areas that you want to address 
or any specific questions.

Also, please confirm if you plan to attend or if there is anyone else not on this distribution that would have an interest in attending.

Thanks,
Jeff
