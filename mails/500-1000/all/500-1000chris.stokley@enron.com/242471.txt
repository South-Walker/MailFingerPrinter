Jim, 
	As per Dan, I am contacting you for help in setting up a common drive accessible for both EES and Corp users.

I understand that the system allows for CORP user to access EES resources but no vice/versa

In either case, the Corp users that are now assigned to EES projects request 2 NT Groups created that both EES and Corp users can be added to that will allow RW for on group and the other to allow Change to a common directory easily accessible by both groups (with out requiring separate logon).

The Erequest for access should be routed to Jeff Richter (jrichte) for approvals.

Please let me know how long it may be until we can have something available.  If you need anything else please let me know.

Regards, 

Dave
