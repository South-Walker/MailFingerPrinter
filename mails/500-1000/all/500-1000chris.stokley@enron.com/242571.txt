Gang,\
=09I was out of the office from Friday morning until Wednesday morning. I t=\
ried to check my voice mail during that time period but was unable to do so=\
 b/c of a problem due my moving to a new location on Friday. I just now got=\
 access to my voice mail which was full of messages of you guys trying to r=\
each me for a conference call. My apologies for this mishap, please feel fr=\
ee to call me in the future on my cell at 503-807-8959. If you do not get a=\
 return phone call within a few hours, contact Mary Vasquez at 5-6349. My c=\
ell is Portland based and has a tendency to lose messages or give them to m=\
e in an untimely manner. As far as the issue at hand, I completed the ExPos=\
t pricing last week and would be more than happy to go over it w/ whoever i=\
s available. Please get w/ Mary and have here set up a schedule for us to m=\
eet tomorrow at what ever opening I have in my schedule. Once again, I am s=\
orry for the late response to such an urgent matter. I can also be reached =\
at my home number on the weekend which is 503-625-3541.\
