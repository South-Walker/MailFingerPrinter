Subject:	January Real Time Final Invoice


Brett,  In talking to Chris Stokley yesterday, he said to draw the amount for
the above subject invoice from your collateral account.  He was going to Email
me a memo stating this.   To date, I have not received that Email.  Since you
Emailed me the information for last billing cycle, can you furnish me this info
for the above invoice?   Would like it in writing before we apply the credit.

Thanks,  Don
