Christina,
	I will not be in the Houston office until late Monday afternoon, could we please move this meeting back until latter in the day(after 3:00). Also, could you please make sure that we have a confer ace phone in the room so that we can conference in the Portland group. Please add Murray O'neil to the list of required participants for this meeting.

						Thanks
