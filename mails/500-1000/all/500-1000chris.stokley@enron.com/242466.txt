I have these in a notebook.  I will work on getting soft copies.  Would you like me to get copies made in the meantime.

Also, I believe all of this info has been provided to the Project Phoenix group and should be on file in their file room.

Becky - let's discuss this 1st thing Monday.

Ben,
	Could you please send me by e-mail, the Deal Overview Book. I was told by Greg Young that you would be the person that could get me this document.. Thanks for you help.
