Bud,
	I had zero idea that Kevin had another baby on the way until he sent out the pictures. He will need to convert to being a Mormon soon if he keeps having kids. What is your latest on the job search? I am currently on a 6-mth project in Houston, so forgive me if my responses are not prompt.

		         The room was full of pregnant women and their partners, and the Lamaze class  was in full swing.   The instructor was teaching the women how  to breathe properly, along with informing the men how to give the  necessary assurances at this stage of the plan.   The  instructor then announced, "Ladies, exercise is good for you.  Walking is especially beneficial. And, gentlemen, it wouldn't hurt  you to take the time to go walking with your partner!"   The  room really got quiet. Finally, a man in the middle of the group  raised his hand. "Yes?" replied the instructor.   "Is it all  right if she carries a golf bag while we walk?"
