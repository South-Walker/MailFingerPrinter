Jackie, 

This is the spot deal we talked about last week.  Craig Falbaum is working on 
negotiating a price.

Daren,

The above mentioned receipt meter is on the 215K (Sitara #152638) beginning 
the 21st day of January 2000.  The actual flow date @ this meter began on 
January 1.  Can you please show the start-date in Sitara as 1/1/2000?

I don't know if this information is of any help but 12/99's business @ this 
meter was on the 215K as well.

Thanks.
