Aimee, 

You need to set up a transport capacity ticket in Sitara for this.  Heidi 
Withers should be able to help you.  I don't know the contract to apply to 
the deal. Heidi or Julie Meters may be able to help with this also.

Daren -

I need a service list contract set up for ENA for the MidTex line for Feb. 00 
and March forward for meter 9735, deal # 203469 (XPRTUNG).  Does ENA have a 
valid contract to ship on the MidTexas line?  Volume managEment would like 
this done before close.  Please let me know.
