Daren,

I have flow at this meter for the first, 118 Dth.  There is an expired 
purchase from Highland at the meter, but, this deal ended August 31st.  HPL 
had a deal with Highland in October to purchase these volumes (deal ticket 
418382).  I think that the deal needs to be extended, it looks like the valve 
was not completely shut by 9 am.  Pat has asked that this issue be resolved 
today, so, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Mary
