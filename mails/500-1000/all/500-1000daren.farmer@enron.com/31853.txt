Bob, 

I didn't check voice mail until this morning (I don't have a blinking light.  
The assistants pick up our lines and amtel us when voice mails have been 
left.)  Anyway, with the uncertainty of the future business under the Texas 
Desk, the following are my goals for the next six months:

1)  Ensure a smooth transition of HPL to AEP, with minimal upsets to Texas 
business.
2)  Develop operations processes and controls for the new Texas Desk.   
3)  Develop a replacement
 a.  Strong push to improve Liz (if she remains with Enron and )
 b.  Hire new person, internally or externally
4)  Assist in develop a strong logisitcs team.  With the new business, we 
will need strong performers who know and accept their responsibilites.

1 and 2 are open-ended.  How I accomplish these goals and what they entail 
will depend how the Texas Desk (if we have one) is set up and what type of 
activity the desk will be invovled in, which is unknown to me at this time.  
I'm sure as we get further into the finalization of the sale, additional and 
possibly more urgent goals will develop.  So, in short, who knows what I need 
to do.

Subject: reviews

Heather will be calling each of up to set up a time to discuss your review 
for 2000.

Please bring with you two items that you plan on working on during the first 
six months of 2001.

These should be items that improve the process around your area or brings 
additional
income to Enron.

thanks
