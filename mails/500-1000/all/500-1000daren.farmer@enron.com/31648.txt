Mom, 

That sounds good.  You can bring the curtains when you come.  What time do 
you think you can make it down here on Friday?  We will probably be leaving 
farily early to go to the rodeo (about 5:00).  We can have the girl across 
thestreet take care of Cole until you get there.

Hey!  The curtains look good--I hope they do when they are hung-- Lacy & I
are planning to come next Friday the 18th. when ya'll go to the rodeo.  I'm
taking a personal day from the bus and leaving early. Thought I would bring
them. Answer & let me know if that's ok.  If you need them before then I'll
try to get them mailed.  Hope sweet Cole is feeling better over his cold.
Love you, Mom
