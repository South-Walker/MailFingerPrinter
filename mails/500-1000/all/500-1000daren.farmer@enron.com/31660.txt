Check out the following dates/times for a training session on HPL 
operations/gas flows/points.  I would allow about 2 hours to cover all 
questions. We may only need an hour.

Thurs 2/10  any time after 1pm
Fri        2/11  Lunch to earlier afternoon
Mon    2/14  11:00am-1:00pm
Tues   2/15 Lunch to 2:30

Let me know the best time for you and your group.  I am also going to invite 
the risk group (their schedule is flexible).
