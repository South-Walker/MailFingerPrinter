Do you mean 12,000 at 6789?  If so that's fine.  Go ahead and bring the Yates 
down also.

Daren , I think I may have lost my mind ( no comment Vance) but did I talk to 
you about meter 6789 taking that volume from 12079 to 1200.  Also Yates has 
averaged around the 3366 that they want to bring the volume down to. Let me 
know what you think.  Husker TOM.
