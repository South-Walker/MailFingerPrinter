 Sitara #256686, PGEV Valero (?)

Daren,

I left you a message regarding this matter 2 days ago.  Was wondering if you 
had time to look into this.

Conoco is saying that we are missing one day of sale to them:  5/5  10,000 
mmbtu at 2.95, deal #256686.

I am not seeing this in Sitara.  Could you please confirm?  

Customer has already called twice asking us to invoice them for this.

Thanks for your help on this.
