I changed the demand to a negative value.  I don't know if this will work or 
not.  If it does not work, I can put the demand on the sale ticket.

Can you make it negative?  We need to reduce our payment.

I finally heard back from Duke regarding Sept 2000.  They agree with our 
spreadsheet, so I need a demand fee to adjust the price in Sitara.

Deal 157288 - demand fee of ($8,745.69)

Thanks,
Megan
