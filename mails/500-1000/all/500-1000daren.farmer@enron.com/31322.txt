Suzanne, 

I was out last week, so I am just now getting back with you.  We primarliy 
served the Texas Desk commercial team, with about 10% of time spent on 
Producer Services.  The non routine activity should be allocated to the Texas 
Desk.

Thanks for your spreadsheet.  One thing I still need from you is what 
commercial teams your group was supporting overall ?  In addition, I noticed 
you allocated 15 hours to the activity ES002 - Non Routine Trade Monitoring & 
Reporting.  What commercial team(s) was this 15 hours spent supporting?

Thanks!
Suzanne

I had problems in getting the newest version of Access.  So, please see the 
attachement below related to the OPM Hours Survey.
