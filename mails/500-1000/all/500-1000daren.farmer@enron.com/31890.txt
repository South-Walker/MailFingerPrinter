Subject: Tenaska IV 11/00

All of the outside sales for 11/00 have been paid.  We now need to forward 
the cash to Tenaska IV.  The demand charge for deal 529856 should be 
$341,250.47.  I have attached my spreadsheet.  The number is based on noms, 
so when we receive the actuals I will send you a revised number.
