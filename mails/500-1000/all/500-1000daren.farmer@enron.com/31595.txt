A help desk person was supposed to come by to fix the problem.  Apparently, 
this particular error is workstation specific.  Let me know if you are not 
getting any help.

Mike, 

The following attachment contains the error message I received when trying to 
log in to POPS.  I need to get this fixed as soon as possible, since it is 
used to assist with our trading activities.  Thanks for your help.
