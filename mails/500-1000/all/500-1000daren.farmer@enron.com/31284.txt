Jackie, 

Please get with the East Desk on this.  If they agree, we can roll the deal.

Subject: 6/4/99 and 6/9/99 (98-0439) Enerfin TETCO

Daren,

On the above mentioned dates, there was no nomination at the Enerfin meter.

6/3/99 and 6/8/99 revealed activity for ENA (202K).  Can the deal be extended 
for 6/4 (548 dec.) and 6/9 (40 dec.) to cover this flow so that Volume 
Management can create an accounting arrangement for these two days?

Thanks
