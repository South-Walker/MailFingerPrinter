Subject: Valero -- Meter 8018

Deliveries to this meter were halted late in the day of January 20. The 
customer has maintenance issues that necessitated an earlier than planned 
turnaround.

It is my understanding from our trader this is another force majure situation 
resulting in no sale or buyback at this meter commencing with the shutdown.

Please take this into consideration when allocating and billing the customer.

Thanks
