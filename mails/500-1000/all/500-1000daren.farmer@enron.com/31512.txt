Subject: Mid Year PRC Meeting

I would like to have our PRC meeting on Thursday, 6/8.  Because of trading, 
we will not be able to start until noon.  Please confirm to me ASAP (by end 
of day, TODAY)  that you will be available.  Please keep in mind that we will 
went last time from 1:00pm until almost midnight.  Your commitment of this 
date will include the evening hours, unless of course, we work quickly and 
efficiently!!!  Sally's meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 6/13, and I plan to 
be on vacation on Friday, 6/9.  Therefore, this is the lastest date that we 
can meet.  Please make every effort to make this work.

Thanks.
