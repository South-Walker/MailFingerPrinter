Done.

FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the 
delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This 
should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th, 
we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a 
spot agreement (#484935).

Let me know if you have any questions.
