Daren,

The above meter recorded a flow on Jan 15 this year.  It has not had any 
activity all the way back through 1999.  I checked with Cheryl Jones and the 
flow is good.  It was apparently turned on for that one day.  Do we need to 
put in a deal for this flow?  

Thanks.

Also, we had a transport nom from Texaco into King Ranch, so we will have 
adequate flow into Stratton.
