Subject: Tenaska IV Feb 2001

We do not have a demand fee for the Feb 2001 Tenaska IV sale, deal 384258.  
Can you please put this in so I can bill?  From your spreadsheet, it looks 
like it needs to be $2,291,888.83, but you can verify.  I subtracted the 
agency fee from the Tenaska IV receipt number, since we already have that 
booked.
