Daren,

 I apoligize for the late notice.  I didn't realize that we would need your 
help until this morning.  Please let me know the time that is convenient for 
you (tomorrow ?) and I will schedule another meeting.  We need to discuss the 
purchase deals on MidTex Pipeline, at meters 0393 and 0391 (HPL's meter#s).  
The first deal is with Etoco, original deal 44829 (12/98-12/99), which has 
been moved to 133435 for Jan 2000 and going forward.  The second meter has 
desk-to desk deals starting Jan 99 to present.  These deals need to be 
scheduled on MidTex meters instead of HPL's meters.
