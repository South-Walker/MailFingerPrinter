I have no idea why payment would be suspended.  I don't remember having any 
problems with Ocean Energy.  Sorry.

Subject: HPLC/Ocean Energy Inc. 09/99 Purchase

Daren, There are five HPLC purchase deals for 09/99 from Ocean Energy Inc.  
They were Craig Falbaum's deals.  A person who is no longer in my group 
suspended payment for these deals.  Gary suggested that I contact you and see 
if you have any insight as to why the deals might have been suspended, or 
know anything that might help.  Thanks.
