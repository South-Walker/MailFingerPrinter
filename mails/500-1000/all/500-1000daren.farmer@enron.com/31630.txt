Daren,

Per Victoria Versen, you can roll deal 166888 forward for one day to cover 
the 14 decatherms that flowed on the 15th.

Thanks

jACKIE, 

You need to talk to the East desk to see if they were allocated this extra 
gas on the 14th and 15th.  If they were, we can change the deal.  If not, the 
pipes will need to balance out during the next flow day.
