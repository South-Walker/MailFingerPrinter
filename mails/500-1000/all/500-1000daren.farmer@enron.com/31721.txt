At Sweeney (Mtr 1517), for December, 6,000/day was confirmed to the Phillips 
sale.  Acutally, we should have nominated a purchase of 4,000 and a sale of 
10,000.  The original purchase deal had the incorrect year on the deal date.  
So, I have created deal 148851.  Please reallocate mtr 1517 with these 
changes; sale of 10,000 on deal 93804, purchase of 4,000 on 148851.  If you 
have any questions, let me know.
