I show that we adjusted pricing for excess volumes for the following dates:


Mar 11-31    15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .045


April 5-19 15,000/day delivered to Mobil Beaumont at IF HSC - .055.  An 
outage occurred on the 5th, so the deliveries to Mobil didn't acutally start 
until the   12th.

If you need anything else, let me know.
