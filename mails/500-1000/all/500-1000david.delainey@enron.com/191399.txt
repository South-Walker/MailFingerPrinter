Wes, can you adjust West Power numbers for the drop in headcount.

Dave,

You asked about office costs, depreciation and headcount:

Office Costs are correct and include rent, supplies, backoffice expenses, 
general marketing and charitable contributions.

Depreciation includes leashold improvements (walls, carpet and paint) and 
certain computers/IT not covered in the IT allocation (Tim is checking on the 
$278K)

Headcount is close: my actual 2000 headcount is 38, not 36 and Tim's plan for 
2001 may be overstated by one or two; overall headcount increase is probably 
15, not 18.

Hope this clarifies the plan.

Regards,

Chris
