Ken, in response to the letter from Mr Miguel San Juan, my suggestion would 
be to offer up the Falcon for their use; however, given the tight time frame 
and your recent visit with Mr. Fox that it would be difficult for either you 
or me to participate.

I spoke to Max and he agrees with this approach.

I hope this meets with your approval.

Regards
Delainey
