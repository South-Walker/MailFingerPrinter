Guys, what is the contingency plan to manage these outages in the event we 
can't manage this as effectively in future situations?

Guys, your teams did a great job managing a very difficult situation with 
very few material effects to the organization.  It is noticed and appreciated 
please pass on to your organization if you feel appropriate.
