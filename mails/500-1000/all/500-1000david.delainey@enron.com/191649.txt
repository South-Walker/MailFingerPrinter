Ok. Laura Luce is flying in as we speak and she should have the written 
feedback drafts for both Cary Carrabine and Russell Murrell (Needs 
Improvement for Manager level). The plan was for both Laura and I together to 
meet with Cary next week, and Laura will be meeting with Russell and I may 
end up meeting with Russell afterwards. 

We will have the final written feedback to Fran by end of next week, after 
the employee meetings. I hadn't planned for David Oxley to be in the meeting 
with Cary. If you feel that is necessary just let me know. Thanks.
