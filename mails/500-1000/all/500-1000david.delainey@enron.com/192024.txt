Steve, I only have the following suggestion for the Office of the Chairman 
paragraph:

 "Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave, in the 
Office of the Chairman, will be Marty Sunde, as President, Global Marketing 
Services and Dan Leff, as President, Global Energy Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  In addition, Janet Dietrich will join the Office of the 
Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Currently, Janet is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas where she had successfully led both trading and origination 
organizations."

Regards
Delainey
