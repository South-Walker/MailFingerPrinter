Scott, I apologize that no one talked to you before this one went out.  I 
assumed that Marty or Dan had spoken to you as we discussed this initial 
change; however, I take full responsibility.  I will guarantee it won't 
happen again.  My understanding is that you have been a significant 
contributor to EES strategy and success.  You can count on a lot more 
discussion about which markets and products are core in the few weeks and you 
will be leading a market opportunity.  I have asked Kay to set up some time 
for us to discuss the market and the future next week.  If that is not soon 
enough, I am around all day today. 

Regards
Delainey
