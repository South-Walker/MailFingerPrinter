Dave,

I am sending this in response to your query regarding the slow payment from 
Wheeling Pittsburgh.  Wheeling Pittsburgh has allegedly filed bankruptcy some 
time last week.  Legal is trying to obtain the bankruptcy filing we are 
beginning to solidfy our potential claim.   Our current exposure is 
approximately $1.55mm ($1.07mm in receivable and $375k MTM).  We are working 
with the steel team (the deal was orginated by Tammy Mulrooney) and legal to 
determine our rights under our contract.  We will keep you posted with any 
updates.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Bill
