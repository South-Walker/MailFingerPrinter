Dave, we have come up with a structure that creates approx a C$45MM tax loss 
to offset our year-end projected C$50MM Taxable Income position. By doing 
this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems 
to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are 
meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should 
keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on 
your radar screen for your discussions with Wes. 

Regards
Milnthorp
