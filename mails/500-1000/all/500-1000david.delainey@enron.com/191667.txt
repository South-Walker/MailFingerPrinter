Guys, this is my first cut on who I would want to be in this group. I think 
this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.  We need to bring 
more people "in" which should increase their accountability for ENA results 
overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to 
evaluate future leaders.

 Trading   Origination  Country Managers  Support   Executive 

 Belden    Dietrich   Milnthorp   Colwell    Frevert
 Presto    Calger   Yzaguirre   Beck    Delainey
 Arnold    Duran       Oxley    Lavorato
 Neal    Bowen       Haedicke   
 Shively    Donahue      Murray   
 Allen    Mrha          
 Martin    Redmond

I would like to send out a note this week to communicate whatever we come up 
with in order to have the right folks available on Friday.

Look forward to your comments.

Regards
Delainey
