Hope you're enjoying the 40 "lit" pens- just wanted to let you know we've got 
your ENA  RC # to bill you for them...$2,000 ..... which just so happens to 
be the same amount that ENA billed me for the trip w/ you & Delainey back 
from Calgary  a few weeks ago...that's the trip during which  I hitched a 
ride  from you all ... amazing coincidence that the #'s are identical.... I'm 
wondering , though,whether I should be receiving a credit for the stamina 
required for a 4 1/2 hour trip w/ the two of  you??
