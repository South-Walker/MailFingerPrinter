Jere, please forward the list of targets. Let me speak initially with John - 
lets try and get this done today.  I appreciate the effort on the peakers.  
As well, I would suggest we start discussions with  Reeding & Bates which 
according to both Redmond and Thompson is a live deal.

Thanks
Delainey

Subject: Re: Producer Insurance Targets  

I was out of town last week on vacation.  The peaker project is moving 
ahead.  George Carrick and John met last week regarding upstream activities.  
No final resolution. I have a voice mail in to John and will get things 
worked out this week.  The most important issue is to get into market place 
and test product with another transaction.

Jere
