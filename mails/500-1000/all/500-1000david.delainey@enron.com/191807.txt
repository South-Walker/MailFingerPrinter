Kay please forward to Max Yzaguirre.

Max, congrats on the Decero PPA - we need to wrestle up another 100 to 200 
MW.  This should be a priority given the profit potential of this deal as per 
Oz and Doug (+50M in 2000).  Is there an ability to let Sabine or Irvin run 
with Vitro and get your attention on this item asap.  I know that the 
Monterrey project is eating into your time.  Do we need to augment your 
resources?

On a different note, the current Monterrey control budget is showing a $5.3M 
negative variance from the original control budget.  Is this accurate?  Does 
this reduce the profitability or is it absorbed by the PPA's?

Regards
Delainey
