Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys 
working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy 
over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation 
does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with 
us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.

This guys sounds a little off.

Regards
Delainey
