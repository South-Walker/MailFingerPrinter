Dave:

Our term sheets tend to be very general until we reach some sort of economic 
deal.  Our group has tended to work this way, but I am willing to add more 
detail as you suggested.

Regards,

Charlie

Charlie, looks pretty general - only comment is what is the Product Purchase 
Agreement entail?
Do we want to go into more detail on the nature of the alliance, the target 
market and the nature of the excusivity (ie) wholesale renewables 
applications, ENA, major state programs - all of it based upon the Conneticut 
job working?

Please review.  I believe this term sheet is in line with our discussions 
earlier today.
