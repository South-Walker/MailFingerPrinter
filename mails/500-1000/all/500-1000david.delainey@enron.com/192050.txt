Dave, East power trading does not have any options capability now. We don't 
price options very well and we have little capability to manage them 
effectively. This will be a huge hindrance to deals this year. I would really 
appreciate your focus on this.

Hey John. Have you worked out the green card issues with the TXU options 
trader? What's the status and timeline for getting him here? Also, Bruce 
Sukaly will be talking with you about Steve Wang's option's background. I 
think you should talk with Steve and decide whether he can fill some of our 
voids from an option pricing/management standpoint. 

Thanks.
