Subject: Laura Luce's limo charge

Kay, I do not approve of the limo charge for Laura Luce's housekeeper. Laura 
needs to either write her own personal check for this or deduct the charge 
against her next expense report. It is imperative that this does not slip 
through the cracks. Since Laura no longer reports to me, Dave should handle. 
Thanks for being so diligent in looking into this.
