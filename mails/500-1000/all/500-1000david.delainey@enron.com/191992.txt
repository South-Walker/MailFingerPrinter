Congratulations on the new position!   I guess they thought that double or 
tripling your budget wasn't a big enough challenge for you!  Best wishes, I 
am sure you will be successful.  ENA won't seem the same without you.

I want to thank you about your advice on Calger.  He is great to work for.  I 
am starting to crank again, just like 1998 (still my most enjoyable year at 
Enron)

Good luck!
