Guys, attached you will find a draft org memo that I anticpate going out on 
Thursday.  I appreciate your patience.  Please give me any comments ASAP 
(only major issues).

Brian/Tim, I assume that we need a communication strategy to HPL employees 
before this memo goes out - please advise.

Please keep this note confidential until release.
