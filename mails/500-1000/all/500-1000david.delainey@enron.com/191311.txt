Guys, I suggest that we write it down in order to ensure that we don't get it 
back as other groups use up the Raptor capacity. We have sufficient market 
data points to do this.  Please advise.

Subject: Catalytica

Catalytica filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC yesterday, December 
11th which disclosed that because of recent market conditions the Board had 
decided not to proceed with the planned stock split prior to the spin-off.  
The supplement indicates an expected initial trading range "at a price 
between $20 and no less than $10 per share".   Based upon these new 
Catalytica's estimates, the value of the Enron investment would be $13.5 to 
$27.0 million.  Enron's Catalytica investment is part of the raptor structure 
so that the impact is on raptor capacity rather than earnings.  The 
investment has also been monetized in a FAS 125 structure for cash flow 
purposes.
