Subject: Austin Energy Groundbreaking Ceremony

According to my records, you have not RSVP'ed for the Austin Energy 
Groundbreaking Ceremony scheduled for Wednesday, November 29th at 12:30 p.m. 
in Austin, TX.  I am trying to determine an Enron head count so we can plan 
accordingly for transportation to and from the ceremony site and the airport 
on the day of the event. 

Please let me know if you are planning to attend as soon as possible. If you 
will be attending, I will contact you regarding transportation.

Thanks in advance for your help in making the Groundbreaking Ceremony  a 
success.
