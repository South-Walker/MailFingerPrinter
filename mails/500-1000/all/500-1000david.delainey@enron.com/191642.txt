Dave,

I am down for 9:00 AM for a couple of hours on Tuesday.  I am assuming that 
this includes my senior team (Parquet, Mcdonald, Vickers, Thomas).  I am 
correct?

Regards,

Chris


PS - I spoke with Tim and we will be ready to price energy and ancilleries 
with respect to SDG&E.  I will work with Steffes on timing, pr and SDG&E 
strategy.  Sorry I sounded negative, but I was voicing Tim's concern as 
well.  Our risk is significant; we just dont want to make it worse.
