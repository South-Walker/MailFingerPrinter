Dave,
?
Attached is a  summary of our test efforts at New Albany.? The new 
combustion  system?performed as expected. We have taken orders from other 
users for the  EA version of the system and will be delivering the first sets 
at the end of the  1st Qtr. The new system would give you 3X the current run 
time at New Albany  & Doyle. Is there any interest in upgrading to the new 
system? I know we  have discussed it in the past.

Best  Regards,
