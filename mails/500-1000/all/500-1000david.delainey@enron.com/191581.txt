David, on a go forwards basis, please ensure that there is a technical sign 
off on the principal investments DASH.  I would like either Bob Virgo or 
Wayne Mays to have a look at these investments from a technical due diligence 
point of view and to be on side before the investment is made.

Regards
Delainey
