Janet, he can approve but can't sign as a director. You need to continue to 
manage. This would take a board resolution to change (ie) he can not bind the 
company as a director.

Subject: Signature authority


Kay, as we discussed previously:

Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority 
for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital 
commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be 
confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and 
land/equipment option agreements.

Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who 
get this set up. Thanks Kay.
