Hi Dave,
I would like to have the opportunity to speak with you regarding the roles 
that certain individuals played in closing the Project 20/20 transaction and 
provide you with input on how to rationalize bonus amounts relative to 
everyone's performance rankings and contributions to 20/20.  I am open to 
your suggestion as to when and how best to convey my thoughts on this issue.

Hope you had a good holiday and look forward to talking with you soon.

Brian
