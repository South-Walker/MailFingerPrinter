John, completely agree with your view - David, I would have the matrix, with 
all of the ENA statistics and names, ready for distribution on Friday to the 
key managers to try and illicit a response from the low participation folks.

I hope the data on these performance reviews is wrong.  I think we need 100% 
of reviews done.  Do you agree.

Attached, for your information is a matrix reflecting the status of completed 
reviews from the mid-year 2000 process.  This is broken down by ENA 
organization units, as they were structured at mid-year, prior to the 
creation of EGM and EIM.

I will provide you with a weekly update on the status.

Please call me at X36628 should you have any questions.
