Jeff, in response to your note from M. Shapiro:
	a) we are formulating a response to Chase on a possible fix to the contract plus who will be the senior sponsership in Enron (as per my bcc from this morning);
	and b) on his offer to help with Kimberly Clark - I would suggest that we meet with Kimberly first, as scheduled on June 1; if it makes sense to use Shapiro's board position to help sell a future deal, lets leverage that resource in the future.
	
Regards
Delainey
