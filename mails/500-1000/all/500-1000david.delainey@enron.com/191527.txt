Kevin, how do we get at the transmission without buying the entire company?

What do you think of a hostile bid for SOCO's transmission assets (Georgia 
Power, Gulf Power, Alabama Power, Savannah Electric, & Mississippi Power & 
Light), and a simultaneously create an ISO/RTO that is auctioned to the 
market.  This would clearly expedite the opening of markets in the SE 
significantly.

I think we could get an FPL, Duke, VEPCO, Entergy, Cinergy type company to 
provide a pre-negotiated purchase price for the transmission facilities so 
our capital at risk would be minimal.  Additionally, we would cut a deal with 
FERC on what the new market design would look like and the ultimate 
transmission owner would live with the market design.

What are your thoughts.
