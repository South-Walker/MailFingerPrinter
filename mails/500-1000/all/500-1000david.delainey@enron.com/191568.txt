Ike, with the danger of being too presumptious,  I thought I would follow up 
with an e-mail to suggest a procedure for trading settlement offers on 
Wednesday.  Attached I have a suggested template for each party to use so 
that we can ensure that we are comparing "apples to apples".  I would also 
suggest that each party provide sufficient back-up to justify their numbers.  
It may also be helpful for TVA and EPMI to use an independent party, such as 
Charles Bone, as the intermediary to facilitate the transfer of each parties 
settlement offer.

I am in the office over the next several days. Lets discuss at your earliest 
convenience.



Regards
Dave Delainey
