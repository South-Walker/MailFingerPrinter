Jeff, go ahead and have the meeting - I think I know what it is about.  Let 
me know what you guys want to do.

Subject: meeting with Jeff Donahue

Dear Dave:

I received a memo this morning from Jeff Donahue wanting to set up a meeting 
with you, Ray Bowen, Wes Colwell, Dick Lydecker, Andrea Reed and himself this 
week regarding Hanover Compressor.  I contacted his assistant and told her 
that you would not be in this week.  She will let Jeff know and get back to 
me.  I haven't heard anything more on that yet.  Please let me know if you 
would like to try to call in or if you want to wait until you get back.

Hope you are enjoying your holiday

Bev
