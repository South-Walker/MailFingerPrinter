Subject: Meeting with ENA Tax

Dave: Do you think your and Lavo's schedules would permit your coming to one 
of my Staff Meetings.  We typically meet on Thursday's at 5pm, but could 
easily modify.  I have an "eclectic" Group of around 35 that would enjoy the 
opportunity to hear from you guys for a half hour or so with a couple of Q&As.

Let me know.  Thanks.

Jordan

PS- Morris and I were in Calgary last week to discuss our Tax position and 
mitigation strategies, Slugger acquisition (I am not confident that we will 
see any benefits this year if we complete this deal.  As Rob may have told 
you, it is moving real slow), transfer pricing, etc.  I think things went 
really well and I would be happy to provide you with more detail, if needed.
