Subject: Request a Meeting

Dave,

Some time back you should have received a voicemail from Paula Rieker 
regarding my seeking a meeting with you.  I was located in India at the time, 
and project Summer was on at the time.  Hence, after a couple of initial 
attempts, I decided to wait a while before I sought a meeting with you.

However, now with Project Summer behind us, I would like to meet with you to 
discuss potential opportunities in the North America Region.  I was part of 
the Associate pool at ECT, and have worked with Jim Fallon and Paula Rieker, 
among others.  I had then taken an assignment to work in India, and have been 
there for some years now.

I am in Houston for the rest of the week and will be seeking to get on your 
calender for a brief chat on opportunities in your group.

Regards,
Sandeep.
