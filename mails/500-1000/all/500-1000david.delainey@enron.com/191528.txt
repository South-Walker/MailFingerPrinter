Joe, EnronOnline is essentially the internet distribution channel for our gas 
and power business.  Rather, my focus on the legacy channel is an attempt to 
increase the probability that more originators can complete transactions and 
generate deal flow.  As well, to reduce the conflict between the trading and 
origination organizations in order to keep us spending more time in the 
market than focused on internal issues.  As far as specifics, you will have 
to wait and see.

Thanks
Delainey

I enjoyed your presentation this morning.  You mentioned that one of your 
current tasks is "pushing the legacy origination/structuring model to the 
next step".  What do you mean by this?  Do you envision using the internet or 
other technology to enhance the current origination structure?
