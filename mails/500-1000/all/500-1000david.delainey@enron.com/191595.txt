Guys, pending the sale of the Wilton Centre unit, I would suggest that we not 
execute the gas balancing arrangement.  The parties should continue to 
operate and invoice based on the verbal agreement; however, lets not execute 
the agreement or put it in the data room.  We should represent to potential 
buyers that we have an interconnect agreement with Northern Border and have 
been accessing supply out of the Chicago spot market.

All other gas supply/transport/balancing agreements for the other facilities 
(including the Northern Border interconnection and the ComEd reg cap deal) 
will be conveyed to the new buyers through the sale of the LLC.

Regards
Delainey
