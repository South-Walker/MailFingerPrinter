Brian, good memo - I think you mean't Energy Capital Resources not Enron 
Capital Resources in your memo.  I would distribute widely in the management 
ranks.

Dave:

I would like to send the attached memo to the heads of the orig groups 
describing the working relationship with Tech Services.  I would also like to 
follow this up with quarterly meetings with each of the groups to review 
resources, deal status, technical risk mitigation.  The meetings are not 
intended to be a technical audit, but to provide a vehicle to coordinate 
priorities and spot potential issues before they become problems.

Comments?

Brian
