Ray, if Mark does not have any other comments - lets go ahead and send the 
memo out ASAP.

Subject: Revised Organization Memo

Dave/Mark,

Attached is a revised memo reflecting Dave's comments.  Please let me know if 
you have any further thoughts.  For the rest of the week, I am going to be at 
Edward Ondarza's offsight, but I can be reached via cell phone (713-416-6429) 
or via email.  Marsha (x33356) can also track me down.

Thanks,

Ray
