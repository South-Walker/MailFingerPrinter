Rick, I have been having discussions with both Joe Deffner and Jean Mrha on 
this one.  Clearly, this is a commercial banking product in which we have 
little competitive advantage unless we take more risk on terminal value or 
collateral (reserve risk).  Ultimately, I have challenged the Upstream Group 
to define the other parts of the deal that would compensate for this 
increased risk and the cost of capital uncompetitiveness.
