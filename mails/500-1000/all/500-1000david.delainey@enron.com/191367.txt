I spoke with Bob Hermann this afternoon and, in short, the single biggest 
contributor to the increase in the corporate tax allocation relates to the 
expansion of state and local tax support being provided to our new "business 
verticals" - that is, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets and 
Enron Net Works - which expense should be specifically allocated to such 
groups rather than ENA, as is currently the case.  I will follow up with you 
regarding the revised number after I have resolved the allocation issue.  
Best regards.  Steve.

Subject: 2001 Plan

Guys, I noticed that the corporate tax allocation to ENA has more than 
doubled from 2000 forecast to 2001 plan ie) $1,600,000 from $700,000.  Could 
you please explain.  Our goal which is being met in ENA's direct expense 
groups is to remain flat year or year from 2000 to 2001.
