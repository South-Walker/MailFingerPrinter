together.

Subject: Superbowl Request

Dave,

I know I should be generating money instead of spending it, but I would like 
your approval to spend $20K on four packages for this year's SuperBowl.  In 
lieu of a mass-market customer event, I would like to target certain decision 
makers that are involved in large transactions.  With that in mind, we would 
like to invite individuals from Black Hills (buyer of PSCo project), and 
either Avista or McCook Metals (buyer of Longview project).   Two Enron 
people (Parquet, Jake or I) would go with two executives.  In the past, West 
Power has signed up for 8+ packages - I have appropriately scaled it back, 
but I do think this type of selective client entertainment has value.

Regards,

Chris
