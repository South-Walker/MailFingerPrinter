Jeff, this fella gave me a call on a new technology that converts chemical 
feedstocks into industrial gases.  He wants to establish the technology in 
Baytown and is looking for our assistance and capital.  This is probably a 
stretch but it may be worthwhile for you to speak with him.  I am not 
advocating this play just passing on the message.

He will be in Houston on Friday.
