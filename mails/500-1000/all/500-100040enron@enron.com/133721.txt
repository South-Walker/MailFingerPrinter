Jackie, a transportation administrator in Omaha, is polite, respectful and professional when dealing with both customers and internal employees. She is often the first contact many customers have when they are getting acquainted with Northern Border. She received her 25 year service award in the year 2000.

Rod, managing director and chief financial officer, Houston, has a great capacity for listening and has an open and relaxed manner creating an atmosphere where people are encouraged to suggest new ideas. He is helpful in exploring new ideas, listening attentively and providing constructive comments. He makes his employees feel like an important member of the team.

Arnold, a division technical specialist in Glasgow, MT, was a key player in establishing a professional rapport with the station site contractors personnel, inspectors, vendor representatives and engineering staffs throughout the course of the Northern Border Chicago Project .
