As we integrate the EBS IT organization into EWS, Sue Klinke, senior director of IT development, will take over as acting head of the EBS IT organization effective immediately.  She will report to Mark Pickering in the Office of the Chair for Enron Net Works.

We look forward to additional synergies between the groups when this transition comes to completion.  As information becomes available, we will communicate it to you at the earliest convenience.

Greg and Mark
