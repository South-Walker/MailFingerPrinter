It is important that our business unit has a consistent, documented approach to spending to maximize our return on every dollar spent.  Effective today, Enron Wholesale Services will follow the attached spend and approval guidelines for the iBuyit eProcurement application.  Please review these new guidelines carefully and modify your purchase activities accordingly.

Many of you currently use iBuyit eProcurement to purchase IT hardware, and others will begin to use the tool on July 2, 2001, to purchase office supplies.  iBuyit eProcurement will automatically route purchase requests for approval based on our spend/approval guidelines.

 
If you have any questions regarding these guidelines, please contact Tammy R. Shepperd at 713-853-6589.

Thank you for your continued commitment to a strategic approach to spending.
