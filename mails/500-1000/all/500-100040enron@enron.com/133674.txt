Enron's United Way Campaign officially kicks off Monday, July 23, with the Leadership Giving Campaign. The employee campaign will kick off Monday, August 6. As part of the Campaign, ETS will participate in the Enron-wide Days of Caring. 

ETS' Day of Caring will be held on Thursday, August 9, benefiting Neighborhood Centers, Inc., our adopted United Way agency.

ETS will have projects at two NCI facilities, with a morning shift and an afternoon shift.
