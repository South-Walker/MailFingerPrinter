Please print and become familiar with the updated ENW T&E Policy, which is attached.  Changes to the policy include business-first travel, 
with supervisor approval, for international flights over 4 hours in duration (excluding Canada and Mexico).  Supervisors will be responsible for making the decisions and bearing the expense for business-first travel.

If you have any questions about the policy or an expense not covered under the policy, please contact Tina Spiller or Lisa Costello.
