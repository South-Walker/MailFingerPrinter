As you may have heard, Dell is voluntarily recalling certain batteries from some of the Dell Inspiron laptops.  The recalled batteries were sold with the Inspiron 5000 series notebook computers, comprising both the Inspiron 5000 and the Inspiron 5000e models (please see the bottom of your computer for model ID).  The systems and/or batteries were shipped to customers between January 7, 2000 and March 21, 2001.

As a result, you will have the opportunity to return your battery in exchange for a new one.  We appreciate your patience through this process.  Dell is committed to your continued service and is sincerely apologetic for the situation.
