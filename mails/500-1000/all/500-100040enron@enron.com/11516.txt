Mr Lay:

I am the Director of Field Operations for Houston Pipe Line Company and request your support on a simple, yet important matter. 

As currently planned, the employees of Houston Pipe Line will transfer to  American Electric Power effective June1. Our field employees look forward to this change with the mixed emotions of new opportunities and challenges but equally with the pride that HPL was one of the original building blocks of the great company that Enron has become today. 

My request is for a simple thank you from you to our employees for the work that they have done for Enron. The professionalism and pride from the last 75 years will go with HPL -----  but not without remembering the significant achievements of Enron.

Thank you for your consideration.

VR,

Ron Green
