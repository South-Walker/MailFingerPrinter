Please join me in congratulating Lynette LeBlanc, another 2000 Chairman's Award nominee.

Lynette, manager of HR Client Services for EOTT in Houston, is a shining example of how employees should treat co-workers and guests. Communication is her strongest attribute; always going out of her way to communicate effectively and making sure all employees are advised of changes and new developments. Lynette helps her department set lofty, but achievable goals, while always bringing out the best in people.

Again, congratulations to Lynette.

Stan
