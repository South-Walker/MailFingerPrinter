Effective immediately, Shelley Corman, currently Vice President Government Affairs and Public Relations, will become Vice President Market Services for ETS.  Shelley replaces Julia White who decided to leave Enron to pursue other interests.

Shelley's replacement will be named shortly.  

Please join me in congratulating Shelley.
