Rod - 

I thought you might like to see the kind of informational reports we get from our operating companies each month.  Attached please find the reports we get from Wessex.  Wessex prepares the report in both local currency and USD, since we have had impacts for the weakening of the GBP.  

These are not the reports that Kenny uses to consolidate results as those are less detailed and also include some management reporting adjustments.  We have been getting these every month since March 2000.  If you would like them going back, please let me know.  Currently these reports are due the 15th of each month.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks!
