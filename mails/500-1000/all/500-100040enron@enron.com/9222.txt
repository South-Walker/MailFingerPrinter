In the past few months, there have been protests at various Enron offices.  These protests have been primarily by consumer and other advocacy groups representing different energy interests.  Attached are security and public relations procedures to help you manage a protest should one arise at your facility.  Feel free to provide this document to leaders in your organization as appropriate.

Thank You.
