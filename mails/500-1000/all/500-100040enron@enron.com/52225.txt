This message is to update you on the status of EWS Accounts Payable (AP) and highlight recent improvements to the AP process.  

EWS Statistics
Thank you for your efforts to keep your iPayit inbox current, which reduces the chance of duplicate payments and directly impacts our vendors' confidence in Enron.   As you can see, we've made improvement in reducing our invoices over 30 days.

If you have invoices in your iPayit inbox that you can not process immediately, please use the new "hold for review" function.  This will let us know you are holding the invoice intentionally and will resolve later.  
	
	

Task Force Update
Here are a few statistics that indicate a positive trend in AP processing:
* Average time from the P.O. Box to your iPayit inbox:  Reduced from 10 days to 3 days
* Critical service and utility payments are processed in less than 2 days
* 75% of invoices received in AP have correct contact information (those missing information are returned to the vendor for correction)

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com.
