Louise:

I will be completing my assignment in Bolivia as President of Gas TransBoliviano at the end of September of this year. Currently I am looking for an assignment back to Houston.  Mark asked me to contact you regarding possible position in your organization. I have been with Enron for the last 20 years in various business development positions. Attached is a copy of my resume. I will be in Houston from August 14th to 17th and would like to meet with you at your convenience.  

Regards,

Nasim Khan
