Please mark your calendars for the first annual ENW All-Employee Meeting at Jillian's on Thursday, July 19th.  Jillian's is located on I-10 West, just outside the 610 Loop.  This gathering is intended for all ENW Houston-based, full-time and part-time employees.

The festivities will begin at 3:00 p.m. and we are considering providing shuttle transportation from and to the Enron Building for those of you needing transportation.  

We look forward to seeing you there and sharing great food, drink, and fabulous entertainment!  We will provide additional details when they are finalized.
