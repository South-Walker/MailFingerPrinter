Please join me in congratulating Terry Thorn on his 20th anniversary at Enron and on his decision to step back from the fray, shift gears and retire on August 1.  For those of you who have worked with Terry over the years, please stop by and join us at a cocktail reception honoring Terry on Monday, July 23, 5:30-7:00 pm in the 50th Floor Lobby of the Enron Building.
