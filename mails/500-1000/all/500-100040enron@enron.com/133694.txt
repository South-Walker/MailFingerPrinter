Recently, Julie Armstrong, senior administrative assistant to Danny McCarty, was honored by the Arthritis Foundation with the "All Star Salute to Excellence" award. This award is given annually to a person who suffers from arthritis and demonstrates excellence towards the community and the foundation.

As an individual who battles with arthritis, Julie's been involved with the Arthritis Foundation for over four years. During this time, she has worked on various committees for the Arthritis Foundation's All Star Salute to Secretaries.

In addition to the Arthritis Foundation, Julie volunteers her time and support to other non-profit organizations, including the Sunshine Kids and Houston Aeros Charities event benefiting the Stehlin Foundation.

Congratulations Julie.
