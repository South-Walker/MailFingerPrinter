Rod-

I suspect your question here only pertains to Wessex and that you don't care about any credit for the other Azurix businesses?

Would each of you send me a copy of your credit policies or the rules relative to granting of credit (credit extended to customers)?     I would expect that it will be in the tariff or some other regulatory document, or even a charteer or license.    I don't need the whole document, only the portion relative to credit.    Please fax or email to me.   
Thanks.
