Passwords
The key to maintaining information and system security is the use of well-selected and guarded passwords.  Because your password is our first line of defense, stronger password selection criteria will soon be implemented for all employees.  

Password Policy

Passwords?
1.	must be at least of eight characters in length. 
2.	must not contain names, userids, common English dictionary words, and begin or end with a number.
3.	must contain alphanumeric characters and contain at least one special character. No more than fifty percent of the overall password can be in English.
4.	must not be reused or cyclical. 
5.	must be changed every 60 days.
6.	must not be publicly displayed.
7.	must not be shared with other users.
 
Choosing a good password comes down to two things.  First, avoid common everyday words a potential hacker's software will be looking for.  Second, keep your password  simple enough that you can remember it without having to write it down. 

Please keep in mind that the Enron Code of Ethics holds employees responsible for password security.  IT Security & Controls conducts periodic audits to ensure compliance with company policy.
