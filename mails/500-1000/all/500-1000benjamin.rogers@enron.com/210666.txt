Unfortunately yes.  The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform u=\
nwind and liquidation functions.  The trading group, the group I am in, is =\
really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probab=\
ly be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM.  I wouldn't mind that because th=\
ey understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and f=\
ixed income.  This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about o=\
ver leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as i=\
mportant as what to do in business.  99% of the folks are good hardworking =\
people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company d=\
own.  It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off. =\
 It was so sad.  Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options las=\
t year, but still lost a little 401 k dough, but I still have my health as =\
my mom likes to say.  On a good note we got your picture of the little tike=\
, looks great.  I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail.  Talk t=\
o you soon.\
