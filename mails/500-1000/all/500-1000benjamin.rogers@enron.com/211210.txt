James:
I talked with Thomas Favinger and Tom Boren is the CEO of PG&E, which is not 
the best guy to send the books to.  The better person is Thomas Favinger and 
his address is:

Thomas Favinger
PG&E National Energy Group
7500 Old Georgetown Road
Bethesda, Maryland 20814

Phone: (301) 280-6231
Fax: (301) 280-6911

National Energy Group is the sub of PG&E.
So please send out 2 books to Thomas tonight.  Thanks!
Ben
