Subject: Story of my golf life!





 >
 > It was a sunny Saturday morning on the course, and I was beginning my
 > pre-shot routine, visualizing my upcoming shot, concentrating on my swing
 > mechanics, when a voice came over the clubhouse loudspeaker:
 >
 > "Would the gentleman on the women's' tee back up to the men's' tee,
 > please!!"
 >
 > I was still deep into my routine, seemingly impervious to the
 > interruption.
 >
 > Again the announcement, " Would the MAN on the WOMEN'S' tee kindly back
up
 > to the men's' tee!"
 >
 > I simply ignored the guy and kept concentrating, when once more he
 > yelled ut, "Would the man on the women's' tee back up to the men's tee,
 > PLEASE!!!"
 >
 > Finally, I stopped, turned, looked through the clubhouse window, directly
 > at the person with the microphone, and shouted back,
 >
 > "Would the person in the clubhouse kindly shut the f... up, and let me
 > play
 > my second shot?"
