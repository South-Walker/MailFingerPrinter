Group,\
\
A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW cou=\
nterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer me=\
mbers in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the g=\
roup to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system =\
is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. =\
Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet ne=\
ed to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost n=\
ever buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2.=\
 We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our abili=\
ty to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly era=\
se this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with reg=\
ards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling t=\
he CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you ha=\
ve questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at =\
the start of September.\

Thanks,\
