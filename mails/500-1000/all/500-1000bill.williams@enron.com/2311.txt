Things have definitely been difficult over here. In truth, I may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes. We are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow.
So Kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else. She probably just shows it a bit more.
We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer.

My apologies for the delay.
Bill

Is Kate very stressed out lately?
I have just noticed that she is constantly angry - how are things going over there?
