Kourtney,

Per our conversation, ECTRT should receive congestion revenue for HE 2, HE 23 and HE 24.
All congestion revenue was across Path 15.  All revenue was at $248.
Volumes were as follows:
	HE 2		8 mws
	HE 23		38 mws
	HE 24		30 mws
	HE 24		20 mws

Total volume was 96 mws at $248, revenue should be $23808.
Please see me with any questions.

Thanks
Bill
