We could pull tapes?  Ask the person who did the deal?  There is nothing in notebooks.  Any word on the BOM PMA?

Bill-

  Can you think of any other means to find out if this deal that we have in the system is good?

Dear Settlements Coordinators,

  I'd like to ask a favor...
  Could you guys please check your counterparties to see if anyone has a dispute on 3-14-01 regarding a purchase or sale of 40 MW at HE 3? 
    

   Sincere thanks,

  Virginia
