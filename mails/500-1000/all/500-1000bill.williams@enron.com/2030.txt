Group,
There is a new schedule out for October. Please take a look at it. If you need to switch days, feel free. Please send Bert and I an email notifying us of the changes and be sure to write your changes on the schedule. Schedule changes need to be communicated for obvious reasons.

Thanks,
Bill
