John,

How was Austin?  Did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for?  How about golf?  Everyone has only ever had good things to say about Austin.

Audi TT?
NICE pick.  Is that a 6-speed?  Only 23,000 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right (matches the 400E).  Next time I am down there (?) you'll have to provide a demonstration.  I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 (this seems to happen about every 6 months), I have only driven it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).  Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).  An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).  Other ideas?

So I am in the new place.  It's great!  Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).  Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.  Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table...
