Kysers,

St-WBOM is long again for HE 2 through HE 5 at PV from PNM at a price of $15.50. We will be 20 mws long each hour for a day total of 80. Same deal # as yesterday--#826094. If you could adjust your sheets for tomorrow I would appreciate it.

Remember, we are also short 50 mws for Monday in SP-15 at $27.60

Sweet.
