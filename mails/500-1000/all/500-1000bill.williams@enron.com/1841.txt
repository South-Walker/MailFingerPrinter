Steph,

Good morning! How are you doing? It seems like I haven't seen you or Scott forever. Things are going well here in Portland. The bankruptcy of Enron has been a bit rough, but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity. If we are bought out, we should be back up and running by early spring. Right now, I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again. Portland has been fun the past couple weeks, there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast. I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping. I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there. I am thinking about coming up for New Year's... any good ideas?
 
Anyway, hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays.
Take care,

Bill
