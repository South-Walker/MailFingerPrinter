Subject:	EPE MARKETING AVAILABILITY

As of today, the marketing personnel will no longer be on call on the
weekends.  The 5808 extension will be forwarded to Enron along with the
5872 extension.  There will be no preschedules or unit commitment plans
developed over the weekend.  Such preschedules and unit commitment plans
will be generated on Friday or the day before the holiday until further
notice.

Please call me at 915-543-4335 or Pete Serrano at 915-543-2045 if questions
arise.

Please share this with other personnel as appropriate.
