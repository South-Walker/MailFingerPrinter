There will be a 100 mw schedule delivered at COB to NCPA going on NCPA rights into NP-15. Phil Platter will be scheduling the purchase from NCPA in CAPS and submitting an HA 24 schedule. BE sure to watch what is in your templates in the morning.

The ST-NW desk will also be short day-ahead to PGE for Friday and Saturday. Diana will be sending an email.

Please call me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill
