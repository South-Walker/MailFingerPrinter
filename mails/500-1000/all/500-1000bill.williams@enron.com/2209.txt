Subject:	EPE Reconciliation Model: Follow-up

Good afternoon -

I wanted to quickly follow-up to make sure everyone is aware of the new EPE Reconciliation Model's location and status. I just skimmed through the first 8 days of this month, and we show no variances between the Real Time El Paso model and our CARP report. 

The reconciliation model can be found at:

	m:/Electric/Epe/Epe01/July01/July EPE Reconciliation

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
