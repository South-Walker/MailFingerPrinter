FYI everyone attending our game.

Here's a little write up as to what is happening tomorrow night.

Our Suite will be open early.  It is Suite No. 7.  (located on the right field side of home plate on level 1 of the skyboxes).

I'd suggest the light rail vs. trying to park downtown.  They ticket cars parked on the street and have them towed if you are not is a designed PGE Parking site.

So - I'm expecting the coach of the Timbers to visit us after the match.

This is an adult event - beverages of the over 21 crowd will be available:

The Portland Timbers announced today the promotional lineup for the upcoming matches at PGE Park, including the Vancouver Whitecaps on June 29th and the San Diego Flash F.C. on July 3rd.
On June 29th, the Portland Rain will play the Seattle Lady Saints in a pre-game exhibition match that will kick-off at 4:15pm, before the Timbers take on the Vancouver Whitecaps in a key A-League Western Conference showdown at 7:05 p.m. 
The Portland Rain women's soccer team is a provisional member of the United Soccer Leagues (USL) W-1 Women's League. Last year, the Rain competed in the Pacific Coast Soccer League's women's division and were undefeated during the regular season, but lost in the 2000 McAdam Cup Tournament. The Saints are the current Region 4 National Cup Champions. 
Also, International Night will take place on Friday, June 29th, featuring The Lions of Batucada, a marching percussion ensemble based in Portland that features African-influenced dance music of Brazil. Founded in 1996 by Brian Davis, Derek Roth and Andrew Hartzell, the group continues to gain members. Over 40 drummers and dancers will entertain Timbers fans at PGE Park. The Lions of Batucada performed in the Grand Floral Parade for the Portland Rose Festival, and in 1998 they won the Rose Festival Association Staff Favorite Award for the Starlight Parade.
