Greg,\
\
I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position i=\
n August.  I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell =\
PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-tim=\
e market throughout August.  NP and SP are currently trading near flat.  I =\
think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximat=\
ely $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California make=\
s this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have d=\
iscussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso. While I recognize the re=\
st of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidati=\
ng in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dai=\
lies because of the current price levels.  This also represents a relativel=\
y low risk trade (under $10 downside).  I also would like to use these posi=\
tions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.  If you have concerns or qu=\
estions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over th=\
e next week.\
\
Thanks,\
Bill
