Group,
There have been a fair amount of changes to the schedule recently--we need to start tracking these "off-schedule sheet" changes.
So...
If you will be unable to work a shift it is your responsibility to find a replacement, and then let me know through a phone call or an email regarding the switch.

Thanks,
Bill
