Bill, 

Attached is a memo outlining dispatch instructions for when your guys are covering our desk this weekend.  I thought with all your new guys they might need a little help.  We have it set up so there will only be a minimal amount of work.

Also, if there are any problems, you can reach me on my cell, as I will be on-call on Friday and Sunday.  The number is (403) 620-5083.

Have a good weekend,

Mike Taylor
