Stewart,
I will be in El Paso visting EPE on the 20th.
But I am very interested in discussing such an opportunity with NW service customers.
Do they HAVE to come on the morning of the 20th or 21st? Could they come the morning of the 19th?
Let's get together and talk regardless.

Nice job on NCPA, I appreciate the hard work.
Thanks,
Bill

Come by and talk to me about an opportunity starting in october 1st.  Basically, Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin would like to outsource some real time transactions to us for a short period of time until they get comfortable with SLICE.  They will probably come in for a meeting on September 20th or 21st in the morning to discuss this.  I would like you to be there for the meeting.
