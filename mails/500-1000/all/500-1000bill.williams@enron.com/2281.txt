Dear Traders,

Agenda items:

Update on DPR impact for each trading group

Discussion on establishing dollar threshold levels for each group

The meeting should last 15 - 20 minutes. If you will not be there, please let me know in advance who will be in attendance for your group.

Thanks and see you there!
