Subject:	EPE Schedules for the past two days

Bill:

Please note the following due to the past two days schedules have been wrong in the EPE Schedules in Excel:

Tag number 6181 has been cancelled (50mw to the CISO).

Lending is wrong in the EPE schedules (it is 75mw from PSCO instead of 50mw).

SPS is wrong for HE 08 (it is 130mw instead of 100mw).

I thought you might like to since this is the only income we have currently for real-time and a major screw-up could hurt our relationship.

Regards,

Bert Meyers
