We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter=\
 months.\
\
First:\
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefu=\
lly manage the units to prevent "swinging" them and increasing the chance o=\
f a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the u=\
nit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-l=\
ine and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold =\
energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual=\
 (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensivel=\
y in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they hav=\
e a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their mark=\
eting group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going for=\
ward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be mat=\
ched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the gr=\
oup to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as =\
efficiently as possible.\
\
Second:\
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very=\
 difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should =\
look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and hea=\
ters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 =\
through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. B=\
e sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in=\
 with ECC.\
\
Finally:\
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(=\
the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews a=\
nd the final two months of the year.\
\
Please see me with any questions regarding the system.\
\
Thank you.\
