Group,
A quick reminder. The night shift will average the sales price and make one strip for the on-peak piece.(so ST-WBOM will sell to ST-Whourly at x$ for HE7-22 then ST-Whourly does whatever it needs to do).
If you have questions just let me know.
Thanks,
Bill

For Friday and Saturday -

We will be long 50 mw on peak @ SP15 - 25 mw under STWBOM, 25 mw under STCA. The day-ahead SP15 price is $27.61. Please sell off this length under the STWHOURLY book and enter appropriate inter-desk swaps.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate
