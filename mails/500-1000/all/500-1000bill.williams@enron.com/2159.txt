Bill,
I just wanted to let you know that it's going to take a couple weeks (I think) until I receive access to the timekeeping system.  Apparently after requesting access, ISC sends back a ticket number and an FYI (below).  
As soon as I receive access I will go back for your group and enter their time, and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month.

Thanks, Jill

Your ticket number is 525114. FYI- security requests are averaging 14 business days.
