Good morning,

Yesterday for HE 10 and HE 11 we were cut Real Time by El Paso Electric on an import (EPMI_CISO_BLUE).  The import was cut by 30 mws and 42 mws respectively.  A purchase from the imbalance has been made.  Also for HE 12,  we bought back most of Harbor Cogeneration's schedule.  Harbor was going to run for 20 mws but could not.  We told Harbor that we would take the charge for them.  Therefore, the -20 mws of generation deviation for Harbor needs to be allocated to ECTRT as Load Deviation.  We put in a purchase of 20 mws from the imbalance in Enpower. 

Finally there is a variance for HE 17 and HE 18 possibly because of load shift from NP to SP.  We are flat in CAPS position manager.  And flat in Enpower.

Thanks,
Bill
