Alan,
I just want to pass on the two names I had mentioned previously to you.
Eric Linder and Steve Merriss. Their home numbers are 503-753-8716 and
503-241-3729 respectively. Both had worked for me for about 8-9 months.
These are the only numbers I have for them as their cell phones have
been canceled.

Bill
