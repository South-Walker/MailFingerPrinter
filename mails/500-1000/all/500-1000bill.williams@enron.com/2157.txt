Heather,
On the new deal summary for 07/23/01, I changed the El Paso Electric deal #697528 price from $4 to $68. I should not receive the $25524.54 as revenue shown in the new deal summary.  Is there any way to recalculate this (or simply zero it out) prior to the morning flash? 
Let me know what I can do to help.
Thanks,
Bill
