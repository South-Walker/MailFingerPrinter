When Colstrip goes down we will be short at Montana system and long at PGE System.  We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border.  If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border.  The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below.


1.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.  Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).  Enter an offset of .10  .  

2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.   (MIDC to MPC SYS)  The transmission fee is $2.52

3.) Go into deal scheduling and query  under the counterparty PGE.  Select all

4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit Stone, etc.
	(these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.)

5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS

6.) Finally link the deals.

7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.

If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.
Thanks,
Bill
