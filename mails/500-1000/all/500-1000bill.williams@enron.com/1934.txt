Brace yourselves...\
Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pu=\
shed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now prem=\
ium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme m=\
orning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 wi=\
ll have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load for=\
ecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the g=\
rid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need =\
to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be us=\
ing congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel go=\
ing in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at=\
 $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get award=\
ed all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday N=\
ovember 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue o=\
n congestion mis-management or poor scheduling.=20\

Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.\
