Amy,
Hey! Great to hear from you! Hope you are doing well. But...
What are you talking about? Who's on what side?
And what are you trying to recall?

Bill

I always knew that you had someone on the side that you weren't telling us about!

Just kidding (Grace sent me an e-mail) - hope that all is well!!  How are things going for you?  How is the Real Time group doing?  

Take care!
Amy
