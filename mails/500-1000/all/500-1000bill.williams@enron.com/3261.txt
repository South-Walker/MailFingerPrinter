Steve, if your information is important - please stop sending it to me.  You must set your e mail list correctly for <bill.williams.III@enron.com>.

I'm concerned that if you keep sending it to the wrong Bill Williams (me) - whatever needs to be reviewed or get accomplished won't happen.
Please take care of this.

If you have any questions - please call me.

Regards
Bill W. (not Bill III)
