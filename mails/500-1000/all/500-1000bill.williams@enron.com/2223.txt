Group,

When doing swaps please use the swap function in Enpower. Do not enter annuities anymore for financial deals. Be sure to specify whether you are buying or selling index and then what index you are selling (NP15 inc/dec...etc).  An example appears in the attachment.  Swaps have caused disputes that have dragged on for months in the past, so call me with any questions.  
Thanks,

Bill
