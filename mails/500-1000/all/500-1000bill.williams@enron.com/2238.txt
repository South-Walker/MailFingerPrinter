Group,

Dave Perrino will be providing us a presentation on losses during the second week of July (tenatively scheduled for the 11th at 4PM).  There is some math/electrical engineering involved. I have attached the presentation that Dave will give.  Please take about 10-15 minutes to get familiar with the presentation and prepare your questions. 

Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Attached to this message is the presentation I am prepared to share with your real-time traders.  Please let me know when you'd like to reschedule me to make this presentation.  

As we discussed a couple weeks ago I have other ideas relating to power systems operations that you may find benefical to share with your trading group.

Kind Regards,

Dave
