Virginia,
We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet.  The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3.  I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue.  Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied.  Fran is aware of this.

I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware.  This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools (if any) likely needs to be resolved.

I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000.
The risk sheet is on my desk.

Thanks, 

Bill
