Group-

As we have more and more cuts, we have an excellant opportunity to refine our cut technique. (YES!)

 1.) In path confirmation workspace-please check all cut paths as "confirmed" (this will allow us to sort for cut or "confirmed" paths later)-and enter notes in the comment section regarding the cut.

2.) ZERO OUT CUT SCHEDULES IN DEAL SCHEDULING. On imports to CALI, please zero out the purchase outside of CALI, zero out the EpmiCalPool, and then make a purchase under the book that had the import (likely EPMI Short Term Cali) from the California Imbalance (remember no price and 24 POS on the group).

IF you have any questions, please call me. We are having a nightmare taking care of weekend cuts, particularly imports into California.

Thanks,

Bill
