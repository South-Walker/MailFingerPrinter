I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26. We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD. Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws. I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064. I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	real time cut 11/25/01 tag 38616

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:

Tag number 38616 was cut for he 06 on sunday.  The schedule was 25mw to the ciso @ mead sinking with MWD.  Calpine couldn't supply the energy so the schedule was cut to zero.  I made every attempt to resupply the power from NEVP, which was willing to sell me the power for $16.00, but Dawn @ the CISO would not let me resupply the schedule.  I thought this to be sort of wierd considering even WAPA was on board.  Please see me with any question.
