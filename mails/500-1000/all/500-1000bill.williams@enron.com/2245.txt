Go ahead and order everyone in the group who wants them the new phones.  Those Eriksons are constantly breaking down.  Let's get ahead of this curve.

I called and put in the order for your headset.  I told them to send it ASAP.  

I also called about the little wall problem.  Maintenance is putting in an order
for someone to come fix it after hours.  

Thanks, Jill
