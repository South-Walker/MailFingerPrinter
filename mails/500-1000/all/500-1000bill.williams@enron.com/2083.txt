Good morning.
We are off in position manager at Mid Columbia because of Enron Canada. I notified Murray at Enron Canada at approximately 6:15 this morning. Position manager is also not working properly, it is reporting a variance at Pacificorp system border ? and at Palo Verde. However the position manager shows no variance when detail is clicked.
If you have questions, let me know.
Thanks,
Bill
