John,\
We have asked every single counterparty in the NW to sell us energy.  We bi=\
d $300 to PowerX and were told that they were abiding by the cap.\
We are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue=\
 to do so.\

Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, beca=\
use MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our=\
 existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time gro=\
up that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficult=\
y securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Ch=\
oice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to=\
 any length resulting from MPC's "domestic" load Energy Imbalance.  In othe=\
r words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during t=\
he hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same =\
time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bull=\
ish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of=\
 late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positio=\
ning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expe=\
cting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to=\
 see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable posit=\
ion we've enjoyed over the last several months. Let me know if you'd like t=\
o discuss this further, or better yet if you've got a workable solution to =\
the problem.  In the meantime, thanks again to you and your staff for the o=\
utstanding performance thus far in dealing with MPC.   John
