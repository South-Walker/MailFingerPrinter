Group,

We are short 50 mws in ST-WBOM at $42.88 for HE 7-22 Friday and Saturday in SP-15.



I have picked up some shaped mws from the APX for the afternoon peak on Friday.  These pieces will need to be scheduled with the APX as the counterparty for HE 12-20.  

HE 12: 26 mws
HE 13: 23 mws
HE 14: 20 mws
HE 15: 17 mws
HE 16: 18 mws
HE 17: 16 mws
HE 18: 17 mws
HE 19: 20 mws
HE 20: 19 mws
Price is $35.

ST-CALI is also 25 mws short both days on-peak.



Thanks,
Bill
