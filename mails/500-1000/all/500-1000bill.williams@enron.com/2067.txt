Christel,
How are you? Hope you are doing well. I got your message last night about leaving the NW. Where are you going? When do you take off?
Drop me a note if you have a chance. 

Take care.
Bill

I'm back.  How was your weekend?  Still putting in long hours or is that over?  I'm pretty pissed. My five day weekend is over and I don't have any more vacation now until I graduate.  A whole month of no vacation????  Aughhhhh!  I'm never going to make it!
