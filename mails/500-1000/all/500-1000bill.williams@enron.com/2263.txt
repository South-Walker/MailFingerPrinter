Nikki,

Hello, how are things going?   Hope you've caught up on your sleep from California.  That's what I am going to work on this afternoon so I can enjoy the weekend.  I am so glad the week is over.  I am exhausted.  Nothing like if I had worked 92 hours though.  

Sorry to hear you only have the night of the 3rd open.  Hopefully you are getting to spend more time in the city of Portland than just one afternoon.  There's just too much to do here to only spend one afternoon.  As for where to stay, there's a bunch of hotels out at the airport, or you can stay downtown.  I can take you out to the airport in the morning if you need as I will not be working on the 4th of July.

Give me a call if you have a chance and have a good weekend.

Bill
