Subject:	Update on Bill Jones brother ( Louis)

I just finished talking to Bill. He said that his brother Louis is not giving up and neither ae the doctors. Bill said that Louis can hear them talk to him and that he responds to feel, though Louis is still in critical condition. Bill said that the Lubbock Fire Department has been very supportive with food and beverages. I ask that your thoughts and prayers be with the " Jones" family and we will keep you all updated as time goes by. Bill also said that visitation to see Louis has been very limited.   


Food For Thought-------Some jobs treaten or take our retirements, and some jobs treaten or take our lives. Now that we know, the kind of cards that life can deal to 
us, ask yourself how lucky do you feel.
