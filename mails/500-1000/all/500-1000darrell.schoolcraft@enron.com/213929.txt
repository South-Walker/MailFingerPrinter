Darrell,
Would you be available for a basic Gas Control overview for these guests.  They are a focus group from University of Florida here to study our Associate/Analyst Program.  There is a possibility of having our program published in a documentary.  Traci Warner has requested an overview of the different business units to educate them on Enron.

Please let me know.

Thanks.
Jennifer
