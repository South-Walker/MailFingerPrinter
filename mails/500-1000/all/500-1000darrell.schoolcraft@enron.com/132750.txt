(1).  We can no longer accept Co2 levels higher than 2% from the Val Verde 
Plant at Bloomfield.  This gas goes 
directly into PNM's system, and we have no other gas to commingle the 
stream.  The alarm limits have been changed
to 2.0% HH. and 1.8% H.  If there C02 exceeds 2.0% Please call the plant and 
request they cut back.  Please log every
conversation due to quality and volumes.  Names and Times.
This complies with our quality limits in TW's Tarriff for the Blanco Hub.

(2).  On the Ignacio to Blanco piece of pipe, we have different language in 
the Tariff to take the higher Co2 as long as 
it blends before it gets to the Blanco Hub.
