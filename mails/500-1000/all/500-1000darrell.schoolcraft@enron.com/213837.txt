Gas controllers on duty were Gayle Henley and Bart Mondon.  They both did a great job.

Thanks DS

Subject:	Smart Pig Runs In Sections 7 & 8

On Tuesday we ran a PII smart pig in section 8 (Station 8 to Station 7) and on Thursday ran the smart pig in section 7 (Station 7 to Station 6).  Both runs appear to be successful.  The data will be forwarded to PII in Houston and a preliminary report will be ready in 2 to 3 weeks.  The final report will take 3 months.  
I would like to thank The teams from Montainair, Roswell and Laguna, the support help from teams Panhandle and Flagstaff, the Albuquerque Corrosion Specialist, and the Roswell Construction & Engineering group for their dedicated efforts to see the project completed.  Long days and short nights don't seem as bad when you've performed well and accomplished the goal.
I would also like to give special thanks to Darrell and the gas controllers for creating the right gas flows for a constant smooth run when the demand in California wasn't there for the gas.  You did an excellent job!
Have a great week-end.
Arnie
