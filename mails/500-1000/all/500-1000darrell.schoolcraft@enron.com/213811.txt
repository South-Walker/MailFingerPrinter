 Dear Heavenly Father,\
 We are  moved by the alarming news and crisis that our country\
 is facing.   This, the greatest nation, founded in the belief of "In\
 God We Trust"  and the "Land of the Free".\
 Please have mercy on  those\
 suffering, hurting and in fear, and give wisdom & strength to  those who\
 are\
 assisting.  May the forces of evil be  broken by your power and may\
we  humble before thee, our strength and  refuge.\
 Give wisdom to all our President & our  leaders\
 and bring your  comforting peace\
 through the  power of your Holy Spirit.  Help us here to reach out\
 to those  that have been affected by this tragedy.\
  In the name of our Lord  and Savior, Christ Jesus.  AMEN\
\
  Please send this to all your  friends and create a prayer chain\
  throughout  this  nation.
