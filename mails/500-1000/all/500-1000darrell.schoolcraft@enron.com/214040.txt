Please note that the original POI 500168 is active/valid in PLE and available to nominate as a receipt or delivery. The new point we set up for the Interconnect (78161) has been inactivated, and will not be valid for transport.

If you have questions, please advise.

Yes, the volumes for the two physical meters should be summed and passed to POI 500168 as a net number, just like NNG does on their sum meters.

The SUM # for these two stations will be 0047109-00. Will this be used for both delivery and receipt? Sig

Importance:	High

It has been proposed by Marketing that the new interconnect (TW/Oneok Ward County - POI 78161) be not used for nominations, but would be removed from our PLE system and that the old POI 500168 be set up as a bi-directional point for nomination purposes to accept both receipts and deliveries at that point.

All flow through physical meter #10187 (new TW/Oneok Ward County POI 78161) and meter #9089 (Existing TW/Oneok(Westar) Ward County POI 500168) will need to be summed and a new sum meter established for POI 500168.

Kevin:  Does this affect your interconnect agreement in any way?

Sigrid, can you please set up the sum meter and let me know what it is.

This change is to be in effect no later than Friday in order to be ready for September business.

If anyone has questions or concerns, please advise.

Can we use a summation meter for the POI 500168 Westar Ward County Meter # 9089 and Meter # 10187
We can make this a bi-directional point in our system.  This will make it transparent to our customers.

Thanks DS
