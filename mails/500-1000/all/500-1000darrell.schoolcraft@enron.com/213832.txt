Subject:	ST Trip Test

Late this afternoon, BVZ requested a ST Trip Test.  We were unable to do it
because of WAPA system problems related to loss of internet communications.
WAPA requested that we stay at 225 MW until further notice.

Therefore, we have scheduled to do the ST Trip at 7:01 tomorrow morning,
Sept. 19.

Possible Outcomes:
1) Go from 225 MW to 150 MW starting at 7:01 and get back up to 225 MW
during HE 10:00
2) Go from 225 MW to 150 MW starting at 7:01 then go to zero if the CTG
runs back.

DETM and WAPA have been informed of the possible outcomes.
