 Dear (INSERT NAME HERE)
I have a small favor to ask. I have friends who are camping their way
around the States and Canada. They have asked me if I know where they
might be able to go without spending large amounts of money. I said I
would
try my friends and family for accommodations.  They travel light and
bring all
their own camping gear, and only require a small place to set up. I have
already given them your name and address anyway in anticipation that you
won't mind. I have enclosed a picture to help identify them if they turn
up. They may bring the green Mercedes or the white one - sometimes they use
both.
Thanks in advance.
Jim
