Subject:	Recycle Line/Coolers

I talked with Arnold this afternoon and he confirmed the following:

1) Coolers were accounted for in the original cost estimate
2) Recycle line costs were not included in the original estimate.

Arnold hopes to provide a cost estimate of the recycle line per station as soon as he can.

I appreciate your input. please let me know if you require further information.
