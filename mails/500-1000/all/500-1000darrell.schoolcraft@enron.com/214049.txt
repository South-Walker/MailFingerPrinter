Subject:	Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Sunday Sept. 2, HE 8:00 AM to Monday Sept. 3, HE 7:00 AM

Operation at peak for 24 hours.
Note that the contractor's objective is to finish his work as soon as
possible.  He will be asking to start this peak run earlier than scheduled
if possible, so the timing is our best guess at this time.
