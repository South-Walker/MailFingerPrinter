Subject:	Revision #3 - Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Thursday Aug. 9, HE 8:00 AM to Friday Aug. 10 HE 7:00 AM

Chillers are now off.  MW output on CT's reduced to 145 MW gross.
Showing 150 MW on both CT's later today as a guess that some Chiller
capability will be restored.

Steam Turbine reduced to 225 MW
