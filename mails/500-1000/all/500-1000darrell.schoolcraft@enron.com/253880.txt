Current operating Capacity of the Oasis Lateral is 340,000 mmbtu/d.  We need to be careful that we don't oversell our capacity.

Subject:	BP WTX to Oasis

Lorraine:
I ran a test case for the BP 100,000 Dth from WTX Pool to Oasis for the term 3/01/01 to 2/28/02.  Below are the findings:

 -- Point capacities for Oasis, Valero and Delhi Ward are okay for the term.

 -- The 24" lateral supplying these 3 points is slighly over the path capacity of 350,000 mcfd vs the FT of 366,000 Dth, for the remainder of 2001.  Lateral capacity opens a little the first of 2002.

 --  Btu content of the gas is 1050

 --  Need 348,000 mcf of 1050 btu gas to get 366,000 Dth through the lateral to the delivery points.

 --  Risk -- If there is a call for all the gas at these delivery points (USGT @ 95,000 Dth, Astra @ 40,000, BP @ 100,000 & Misc. @ 131,000) then  we are at the maximium flow.  Any facilities problems or summer temperature extremes and we might not operationally make the delivery volumes.

My recommendation would be to only allow 90,000 Dth from BP.  Historically USGT has not utilized their full 95,000 Dth.  Do we want to take the risk and allow BP the full 100,000 Dth.

Darrell, I need some help with this one.  Give me a call.
