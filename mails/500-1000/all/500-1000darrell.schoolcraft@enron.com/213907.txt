Darrell,
We have an EBS customer visit from Continental Airlines coming through tomorrow, Tuesday, July 3, 2001.  This visit is going through Joe Edwards, Director, EBS and Sarah-Joy Hunter, Director, GSS.

They are two people from their IT department coming in to discuss a Bandwidth deal. This is all the information I have at this time.  I do know that they are pretty far into their discussions and this could be a substantial deal for EBS

We wanted to give them an overview of Enron's pipeline business (approx. 15 minutes max).  

They would arrive at 1:30 pm.

Please let me know.

Thanks!
Jennifer
