Dave can you please add the new La Plata Red Cedar point to the map.
Please add it between Mapco and Red Cedar points.
Also please check to see if the Rio Puerco receipt and delivery are added
into the totals of the Central Area.  If they are in the total please exclude them.
Rio Puerco is a stand alone point.  Rio Puerco should still be added into the
total Transport Receipt and Delivery.
If you have questions please call.

Thanks Ds
