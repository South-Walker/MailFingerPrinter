When PG&E does a re-alignment on the weekend, please contact the TW logistics person and let them know so it can get scheduled.


On a second note:
When PG&E requests to swap volumes to Socal the actual flow has to take place at the Topock points only.  They cannot take it to 
Needles.

If you have any questions please call.
