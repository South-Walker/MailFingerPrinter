We did manage to avoid a complete plant outage, but the loss of gas
pressure yesterday morning was still a major upset.
CT #1 did trip off and then subsequently it took several hours of
struggling to get back to where we needed to be.  We didn't get back to
peak load until 2:00 PM in the afternoon.

I'll send you data on gas usage for yesterday by separate E-Mail for your
information.
Your assistance to get all the facts related to this event will be much
appreciated so we can learn how to not go there again.

We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that
during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.

Ken,
Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control
so we could correct the problem before the plant
went down.
If you have any more questions please call.

Thanks DS  713-853-4299
