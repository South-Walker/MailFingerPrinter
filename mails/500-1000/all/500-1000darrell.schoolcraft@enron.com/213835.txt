Subject:	Griffith Schedule - This Weekend - Sept. 22-23

At the moment the plant is down waiting for delivery of parts to repair
steam valves.  Parts may arrive this afternoon but there is no guarantee.
BVZ have no schedule for startup and therefore no gas has been nominated
for the weekend.

When the plant is ready to start up, operation will be based on gas
availability at the time.

All units should be capable of operating.  Expect to be able to get to base
load approximately 24 hours after startup.
