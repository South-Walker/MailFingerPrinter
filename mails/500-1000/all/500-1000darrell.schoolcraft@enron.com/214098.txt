Linda, I have reviewed the procedures briefly - but wanted to respond as time get away.  We may want to meet on this.  I did notice that the timing on #6 will not work.  Gas Control's meeting is after the time for Limited Day posting which is 26 hours (@7:00 a.m.) prior to beginning of gas day.

Attached is a 1st Draft of some procedures for TW concerning the levels of firm capacity sold on the system.  I started with NNG's procedure and modified it for TW.  Please let me know your comments or if you'd like to meet to discuss.  We can include an approval form similar to NNG's too.
