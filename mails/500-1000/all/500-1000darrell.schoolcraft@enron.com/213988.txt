Subject:	Request for Panhandle Pigging

Darrell,
Per our phone conversation this morning, I'm requesting gas to run pigs on the Panhandle Lateral next week.
Preferred Schedule:
  Tuesday - 8-14-01 - River to P-1
  Wednesday - 8-15-01 - P-1 to P-2
  Thursday - 8-16-01 - P-2 to P-3
I spoke with Tony Teakell and he said they can run the pig from P-2 to P-3, even with short notice.
If you and/or Gary can't get the flows at these times, contact us as soon as you know, so we can work around it.
Thanks,  Arnie
