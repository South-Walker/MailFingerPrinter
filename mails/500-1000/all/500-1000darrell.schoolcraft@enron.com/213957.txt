Becky:
There will be a meeting at 3:00 PM MST today to update our startup plan.
My predicion this morning was that we would not need gas before Monday,
morning July 30, but there is a slim chance that startup may occur late
Sunday, July 29.

The good news is that the gas requirement for the startup day will be less
that 10,000 MMBTU's.  Can we take that much on Sunday if they get ahead of
schedule?

By copy to Kim:  We do not expect to make any MW on the startup day. In
fact after the Steam Blow activity, we will shut down for several hours to
put the steam piping back in an operational state.

Ken
