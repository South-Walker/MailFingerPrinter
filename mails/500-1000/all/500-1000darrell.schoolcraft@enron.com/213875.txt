There is volume flowing to the plant.  The team is trying to get the Scada back in service.  Will keep you updated.

Thanks DS

looks that way but Darrell is inquiring to double check - there is a possibility that the volumes are not coming into SCADA - 
Darrell will let us know

There continues to be a need for volumes scheduled as a delivery because this feeds a receipt to California.  As of 10/9, contract #26813 has deliveries of 28,098 and contract #27583 has receipts of 8,709.  Are you also telling me that North Star Steel is not burning anything?!?

Why is there currently a nom for delivery to North Star Steele.  It doesn't look like they have taken gas from us in a while since 10/1

or have they???
