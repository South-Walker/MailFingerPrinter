Why are we doing a hot tap?  Is this a new I/C?   If so is it a receipt or delivery.  Seems like gas control doesn't know anything about it.

Thanks ds

Subject:	Hot tap on TW 24"

On Monday, July 9th commencing at 0700 we will be doing a hot tap on the TW 24" panhandle lateral at the Rockwell Place meter near Canyon, Texas. This is merely a courtesy notice as the scope of work will not require any manipulation of line pressure or interruption of service. 

Thank you,
Eric Haiduk
