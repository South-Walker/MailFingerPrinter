Gentlemen, here's the first round.

I would like to set up a meeting to go over the outages on TW for 2002. The attached outage report includes the outages I have in the system data base. All the dates are up for discussion, thus the reason for this meeting. If there are any other outages the group is aware of for 2002, this would be a great time to put them on the list. That way we can work on the best plan for 2002. I would like to set up a conference call sometime next week. Maybe Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, let me know. If your plans allow you to be Houston would be even better.
