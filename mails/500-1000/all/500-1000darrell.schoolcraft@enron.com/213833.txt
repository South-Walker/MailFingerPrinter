Darrell,

	I know you're very busy but Ranelle is the new Pricing Desk person and needs info on the southend of the pipe.  I was wondering if you could give her a call and get her up to speed on the area.  Sorry, but you're the best guy for the job.

HELP!!!  I really need an explanation of how TW, NNG, and El Paso fit together in the South End.  I am so lost.  Do you have any time to just talk to me about a couple of points?  I know you are busy right now, so when you do have a free moment.  Or, is it better if I call Vernon?
