Subject:	Blk 831 Outage

BP-Amoco has requested a meeting take place in our offices on the afternoon of September 11th, or anytime September 12th or 13th.

Please check you calendars and let me know when you would be available. They are interested in discussing the outage and the resulting delays in re-establishing service.  Also, they are wish to  understanding the nature of the delays, the likelihood they may be repeated in the future, how communications between our companies can be improved, and how to promote a better relationship at the operations level between our two companies.

They mentioned that they have suffered economically, and may seek some form of restitution.

Thanks for your help,

Bob
