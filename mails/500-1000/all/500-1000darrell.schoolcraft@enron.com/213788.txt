Was on a conference call with Keith (TW gas control) and Ken Gruel (Griffith plant) Monday morning (September 3) 
concerning pressure drop at the Griffith plant.  It was discovered that the TW mainline setpoint had been changed to 
reflect the new order of 35,000 for the day.  The plant sent TW a schedule of hourly burns for the day.  They had 
intended to take their 24hr rate with-in 12 to 14hrs.  Asked Keith to raise the TW mainline setpoint to approximately 
120,000.  
After speaking with Keith off line and asked him to open the spead sheet from Ken on their takes asked him to figure
the hourly take for the 24 hrs.  He said that he made a mistake and didn't look at it.  The Griffith plant has been on line
since sometime in April and this should not be anything new to the gas controllers.
Asked Keith to call Ken back with Griffith and make sure they had Gas controls E:mail address and or fax number to send
any revisions. 

Thanks DS
