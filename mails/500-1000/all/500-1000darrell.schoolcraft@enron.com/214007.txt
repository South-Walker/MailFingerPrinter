Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

Thanks
Rich
