I called Steve Richards at the station and this unit is in plant held for future use.  I told him to get started.
This is for unit 602 down from 1/16 to 5/31.  We will still have two units available.

Jerry,
I talked to Ronnie Morse, and he says the outage at Station 4 is scheduled to be completed 5-3.  They will then send equipment in to be repaired or rebuilt and then returned to Station 6.  Am attaching outage request and if there are any questions, please call or e-mail. 
Thanks,
