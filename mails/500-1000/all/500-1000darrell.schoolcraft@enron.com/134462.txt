Melissa left a message that the volumes should start flowing to make the imbalance for the month.  They cannot 
split stream flows.

I left a message with Pam Stiegerwald, I'll tell her she should move her gas, otherwise it'll be allocated.


Thanks,

3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.

Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?
