We need to make sure that when we have any issues concerning the Griffith plant we put something on the log.
It has been brought to our attention that we had a problem on Aug. 6th and Aug. 14th and there is nothing in the 
logs about anything.  I was here on the 6th and know they almost ran themselves out of gas because they started
pulling more than our setpoint and did not call to let us know.  If anyone can recall what took place on the 14th 
please drop me and e:mail.
Citizens is trying to gather information on these days based on complaints from Griffith plant.

Thanks DS
