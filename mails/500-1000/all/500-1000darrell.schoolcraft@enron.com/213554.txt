We currently have an accumulated imbalance due TW from PNM of approximately 375,000 mmbtu.  We do not 
need to let this keep growing.  Talked with Chuck Thompson (PNM) and we both have agreed that TW is not 
to over deliver to PNM until we can verify the measurements.  We need to keep the total order in balance.
We will work on this next week.

Thanks Ds
