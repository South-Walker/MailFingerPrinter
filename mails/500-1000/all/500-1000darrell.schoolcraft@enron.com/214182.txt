Someone needs to call Jerry Graves or myself to schedule a pig run.  We will need to have some coordination to flow gas from the P-3 side
of the Canadian station to ensure you enough gas to run the pig to feldman. 
With max flows from the P-2 area they can run a pig from P-2 to P-3 anytime.  It just needs to be coordinated with the teams and gas
control.
Mickey, hope this answers you questions.  If not call me.  

Let us know.

I had sent you an email in regards to pigging on the TW 24" Panhandle Lateral and the TW 12" Leedey Lateral. I haven't heard anything and wanted to make sure you are still the person that we need to visit with on getting these task resolved. If not, please let me know who we need to talk to.

The problem is we haven't ran a pig on these lines in years. In order to insure our pipeline integrity, we need to work through these obstacles and get something resolved. We know we have lots of liquid in these lines and need to proceed with pigging.

Please let me know what we need to do to get this accomplished.

Thanks,
Mickey
