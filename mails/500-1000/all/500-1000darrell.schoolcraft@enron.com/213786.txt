This is what Ken sent for gas consumption during the pressure loss.

Subject:	Plant Data - During Loss of Gas Pressure - 9/3/01

Below is Griffith plant gas consumption data for yesterday 9/3/01.
You can see that from the time of loss of gas pressure, HE 8:00, we did not
recover until HE 14:00.
This of course extended our test schedule which required even more gas for
the day.

Note: Duct Burner #2 instrumentation is defective, otherwise the data is
OK.
