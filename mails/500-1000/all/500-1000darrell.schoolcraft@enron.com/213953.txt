Subject:	Griffith Energy Schedule for Friday HE 8:00 AM to Saturday HE 8:00 AM

At the moment the Griffith Facility is still shut down because of a valve
failure in the steam system.

The earliest anticipated need for gas would be Saturday morning, July 28.

The task at startup will be to blow steam through the system at high
velocity in order to purge possible debris from steam lines.  In this
situation, gas will be needed but electric power will not be produced.

I will update everyone tomorrow morning on our plans for the weekend.
