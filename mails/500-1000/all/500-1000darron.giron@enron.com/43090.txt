Don't worry about it.  If you can't go, you can't go.  You are not going to 
pay for the tickets if you don't use them.  Hope you feel better.

Darron,

Thank you for the directions and the tickets.  Unfortunately, I have not been 
feeling well and I may not end up going.  However, I should know more by 
tommarrow.  If someone else can use the tickets then by all mean let them use 
them.  If no one uses the tickets, then I will cover the cost of the tickets 
since you were saving them for me.  I still really want to go and maybe after 
another nights rest I might feel better, so I will give you a call in the 
morning.

Thanks again.

Adios,

JDLIII
