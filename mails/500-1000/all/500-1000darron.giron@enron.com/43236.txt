Jay,

I want to set up a monthly automatic transfer from my checking account but 
have had trouble getting a PIN number from the phone number that was mailed 
to me.  I want to have $1,065 transferred into the CMA account; on the 15th 
of each month if possible.  I would like $150 transferred into 226-27211 and 
then used to purchase the mutual fund already in the account, $175 
transferred into 226-27210 and then used to purchase the mutual fund already 
in the account, and then have the remaining amount ($740) used to purchase 
the mutual fund in the CMA account (226-27209).  Please help.  Thanks.
