Genaro,

The Sitara was not updated for Aug.  I just corrected Sitara.  So you can 
redraft in Unify.  I attached the completed calc-sheet.  Sorry for the delay.

Darron,

 Do you put together a spreadsheet calculating the price for gas purchases 
from Agave on NNG at the Hobbs Plant? If so, can you forward a copy to me? 
For 08/00 production, there is a $.56 difference from what is in Sitara and 
what the customer invoiced us.

Thanks,
Genaro
