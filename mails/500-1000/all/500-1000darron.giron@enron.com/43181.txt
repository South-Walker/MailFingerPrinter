Sean,

How's CO?  I hope you are doing well.  I know I have asked you before, but I 
seem to have accidentally deleted your dad and sister's email addresses.  I 
want to ask you dad if he will be in town when KU plays Texas later in 
November.  I want to bring the whole family.  If you get a chance, shoot me a 
message with his info.  My mom is vacationing in NY so I can't ask her.  
Thanks.

DG
