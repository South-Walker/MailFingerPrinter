Subject: North Shore - Deal 116695 - pricing adjustment

Barbara Dillard's worksheet shows the full 10,000 MMBtu for 8/1/00 - 8/2/00 
as SIQ (see below) which is priced at NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD, 
not tier priced as shown below in Sitara.  Unless there's some reason I'm not 
aware of, can you please change the full volume to be priced at 
NGPL.ILL-CITYGATE.NGI.M.I - .02 USD.

Thanks,
Kevin
