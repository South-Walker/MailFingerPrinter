Hey bunko gang...Unfortunately, Gary and I will be out of town that weekend.  
We are going on Gary's company's trip so we need to reschedule.  What do you 
guys think about September 30th?  Let me know who all can make it or suggest 
other dates that are more agreeable to your schedule!

Thanks,

Dawn

Hey - we have not done this in a long, long time.  Dawn and Gary want to host 
a party at their house on Sept. 16th. 

Who is interested?  let us know asap so that we can find subs if needed!
