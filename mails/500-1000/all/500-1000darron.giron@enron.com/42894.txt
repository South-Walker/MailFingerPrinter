We have a 7:30 shotgun start tomorrow morning.  We will have to pay and get 
out to our hole, so give yourself some time if you want to hit a few before 
we tee off.  We still need one more person.  Everyone else already had 
plans.  If you know of anyone who would like to play, invite them and let me 
know his name.  Unfortunaltey Jeff, you are the only guy who is any good.

West on Hwy 290
Pass the Beltway - Remember I said it's BFE
Exit Spring Cypress/Cypress Rosehill (About 12 miles past the Beltway)
Go thru 2 stop signs (First one is Spring Cypress-Second one is Cypress 
Rosehill)
After 2nd stop sign, make first right (there is not a stop sign at the 
intersection) - I believe the street is Cypress Chase
The road will dead end into a T
Make a left and the course is on the right - You can't miss it

I'll have my cell phone on if you get lost - 832-563-6328.  Call me if you 
have any questions.  Thanks.
