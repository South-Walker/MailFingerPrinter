I believe we are in agreement on the new deal amounts.  I held back 
$1,087,409 from the MEH book.  The MEH book lost $ mostly because there was 
$20K added to the P&L last Friday.  I did not add that amount back in 
tonight.  I don't know what it is.  I'll talk to you in the morning.  Let me 
know if there is something you want me to send you.  Thanks.
