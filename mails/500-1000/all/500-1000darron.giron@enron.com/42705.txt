Kam,

Jim called me about this and I asked him to email me.  But all these storage 
facilities are on the East desk.

Per our conversation, please advise as to what GD index Enron would use to 
value physical storage on the following East pipes:

Cove Point - I think it is in Maryland.  Acquired from CES
National Fuel -
Tennessee - which of the many indices
Napoleonville - 
Transco - which of the many indices


Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.  I need this for 
our auditors.

Thanks.
