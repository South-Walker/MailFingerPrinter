Jeremy,

Currently, all of our index deals are in the FT-WEST book.  I would like to 
move them all to the GD-NEW book.  I don't want to change any price or basis 
portions of a deal currently in the FT-WEST book, only index.  Please let me 
know if you can do this.  If you have any further questions, please call.  
Thanks.

DG    3-9573
