OK, so I really screwed up.  I was getting the tickets out last night so I 
wouldn't forget them this morning and remembered that I am going to the 
airport, not the office.  So I'll call you when I get in later this 
afternoon.  I thought about FedEx, but don't want to take the chance that 
they get lost in the Enron building.  I hope you travel via 290 to Austin 
because I think the easiest solution is for me to leave them at my house and 
you could pick them up on you way out.  I also have a couple of EndZone 
passes with the tickets.  Sorry for the screw-up.  I'll talk to you this 
afternoon.
