Mike,

How goes it?  I was thinking about you guys this weekend.  We were in town 
for the game (if you want to call it a game).  We ended up staying at a 
friends place.  I think that is the first time in quite a while we haven't 
seen you on this particular weekend.  We are still plugging along.  How about 
you?  I thought I heard you were buying a new house.  Is that right?  Well, I 
just hadn't talked to you in a while and I saw you email address on a message 
from Sean.  We are going up to KU for the Texas game again.  I can't believe 
it has been 4 years since we were up there.  Take care.

DG
