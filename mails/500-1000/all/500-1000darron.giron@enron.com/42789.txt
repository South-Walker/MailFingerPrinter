This is a physical deal.  Leg 4 is unwinding Leg 1.  Leg 1 had the Price and 
Basis components and Leg 3 had the Index component.  I am in Chicago today 
and tomorrow.  If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Darron:

Leg 4 of this deal is in TAGG as a physical swap instead of a physical 
forward.  Is this a physical or financial deal?

Thank you:

Derek
