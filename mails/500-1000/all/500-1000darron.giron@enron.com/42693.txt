Subject: January Originations


The originations below were granted to Barry Tycholiz in January.  Per Barry, 
these originations should have been granted to him through "West Gas 
Origination" rather than "Middle Market - West".  Please make these 
corrections in February in order to correct the NG P&L for the quarter.  
Thanks for your help!  Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,
Misti
