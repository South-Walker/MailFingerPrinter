I think it will be a very close game.  Except for the fart against Colorado,  
you just don't bet against the Aggies at Kyle Field.  OU is obviously a very 
good team.  But I think more importantly, they are just playing great 
football.  They make plays when they need them, and I know it sounds like 
sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky.  When the QB heaves a 
pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a TD week after week, 
the football Gods are smiling on you big time.  But regardless, you've got to 
admire Stoops and the job he has done.  They have proven for three 
consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best 
defenses in the country.  

And as far as the Horns are concerned, I still think they are just an above 
average team.  They have beaten no one of any (and I mean any) significance.  
They were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best 
team in the country) good team they have played.  And lost to a bad Stanford 
team.  But the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may 
result in a T+1 win.  But right now, I think the Aggies have a better team.  
But if they start thinking about aTM, they will lose to both Tech and KU.  
They are not good enough to play poorly and win against decent competition.

Don't think  I'm crazy, but I think the Aggies will beat OU (man I would
hate that, we would never hear the end of it).  Crazy things happen in
College Station,  I wish I were out of the country on that day.   Right
now, the Aggies look like they could beat us.  We better get our shit
together.  What are your thoughts?  Again, I hope I'm wrong but the Aggies
worry me.

Later
