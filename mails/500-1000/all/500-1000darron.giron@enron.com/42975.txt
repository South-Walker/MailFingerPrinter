Subject: Please change the supervisors for Analysts and Associates

Susan, 
Since the following Associates and Analysts are outside of ENA in Corporate, 
I can't change their supervisor information.   Could you please change the 
following records to reflect the supervisors named below?

Rahmaan Mwongozi  supv.  David Baumbach
Robin Rodrigue supv. David Baumbach
Christopher Walker supv. Darron Giron
Jennifer Bagwell supv. Darron Giron

Thanks for your help, hgm
