Subject: Real-time NYMEX quotes

As discussed in the brown bag classes today many people would like to be able 
to see the NYMEX prices updated in real-time.  Attached is a modified TDS 
file that will listen to the NYMEX price.  When you open the file an error 
message appears but the file does work.  Just go to the listen page and you 
can see each of the months.  Please forward this file to your group if you 
feel it will be useful to them.  If you have any questions just ask.
