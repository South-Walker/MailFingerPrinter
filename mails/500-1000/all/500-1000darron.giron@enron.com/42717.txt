Jay,

I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously 
discussed.  It is effective Feb 20th.  I need to change the amount 
transferred to account  586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 
from $175 to $200.  I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA 
account.  I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and 
account 586-94019.  This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.  Let 
me know if I need to do anything else.  Also, when are the 
recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?  I will 
need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.  Call me if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

DG
