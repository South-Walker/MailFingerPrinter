Jeff,
I think Risk can do two things to improve the process:  have more of us 
involved in the process so they actually see the implications of booking 
deals incorrectly and actively following up on recurring problems.  This last 
one I am particularly bad about.  I will see a variance that is rather small 
and just take it without looking into the underlying cause more carefully.  I 
think the OA group in general should take a more active approach in 
preventing problems rather than just identifying them.  But I know that is 
easier said than done.
