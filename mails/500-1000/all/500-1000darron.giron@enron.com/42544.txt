You can get good speaker packages, but many of them are not really good.  
I'll bring some magazines that have articles on some good speaker sets.  You 
can also just put your own package together.  If you do this make sure the 
speakers are of the same brand.  This is what I did for Scott.  Many of the 
speaker packages use  5 small speakers and a sub.  But I suggested larger 
front L&R speakers to Scott for playing music.  Any decent receiver will have 
a decoder built in.  And I do have some brand names, but it really depends on 
how much you are willing to spend.  I'll go through my stash of magazines 
tonight and see what I can find for you to read.

Scott,

Did you buy your surround sound speakers as a package
(left/right/center/surround left/surround right/subwoofer) or did you buy
all the speakers separately.  I would like to buy them all as a package or
maybe all but the subwoofer and buy that separately.  What did you do??  I
have seen some pretty cool JBL Speaker Packages.

Also, what reciever did you get? Even though your DVD player has a decoder
built in, I am assuming that your reciever has a decoder built in also.

Darron, any advice on what brand speakers/receiver etc. and where to get??
