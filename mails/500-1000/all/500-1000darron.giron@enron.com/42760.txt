Darron,

Per our earlier conversation, please direct me to the individual responsible 
for each of the desks listed below.  As part of my testing, I will be looking 
to identify the P&L drivers for each month as well as the days throughout the 
month that have the largest P&L.  


November  December
FT-NWEST  FT-NWEST
MGMT-WEST  MGMT-WEST
FT-WEST  FT-WEST

Thank You,
