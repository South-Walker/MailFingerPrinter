I am working on OA for phase II Dec prod.  It looks like there are 
liquidations on the buy side that equal the variance on the sales side for 
the above ref counterparty.  Look at NW9561.2 and NX4842.2.  Is it okay to 
assume that these liquidations belong on the  purchase side.  This is for the 
west region.


Call if you have questions.

Thanks!
