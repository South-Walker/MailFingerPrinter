Subject: 

I spoke with Bill K. about the TDS positions problems we had this morning.  
They had to take TDS down this weekend and when it was brought back up all 
the positions were reloaded.  

He thinks the new TDS portcalc will be ready to go later this week which will 
prevent this from happening again.
