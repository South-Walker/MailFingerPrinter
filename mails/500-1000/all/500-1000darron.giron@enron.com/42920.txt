Subject: Deals in FT-Northwest book to be flipped to FT-US/CAND-ERMS book

Hi Darron,

Please move these deals to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by the end of tomorrow.



Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Also, please make sure 
that there aren't any deals between ECC and a third counterparty in any of 
your books.  If there are, could you please flip them to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS 
book.

Thanks
Stacey
