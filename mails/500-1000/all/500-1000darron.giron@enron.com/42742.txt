Greg,
I got confirmation from the Head Coach at JV that AR is not going to UT. He 
scored a 760 on his SAT and apparently overslept a retake exam.  So I don't 
know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either 
way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really 
dissapointed in AR.
