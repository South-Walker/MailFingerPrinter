Jay,

There is still some cash in the custodial accounts.  I wanted you to buy more 
of the existing mutual funds.  Also, I am going to write a check out of my 
CMA account for more than the current cash balance.  Do I need to sell some 
mutual fund shares? Or is it automatic?  Let me know.  Nice game in Palo 
Alto.  Once again the Horns can't live up to the hype.
