Doug,
The Sitara numbers for both of these deals are in the comments section of 
each deal in Tagg.  Do you have access to Tagg Deal Capture?  The Sitara 
numbers are 344737 (NS3520) and 344952&343785 (NS4159).  If you don't know 
where to look for these, let me know.  They were both available in the 
systems.

DG    3-9573
