They are selling gas from Montebello.  

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (principally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to actually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book value--unclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff
