I guess I can't make it as I sit here in windy/wet/cold weather. I just
checked the internet and Weir is tied for 2nd. Maybe if it returns in a
couple years I will be able to come down. I'll look for you this weekend.
Will you be the guy in cut off sweats and a muscle shirt (Dauphin golf
course dress code)?
