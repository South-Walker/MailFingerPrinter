Jeff, further to our conversation... this is the list of companies that have entered into contractual agreements with the DWR. I don't know if this means they have transaction but perhaps between Kim Ward and yourself, you can advise.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

Once I know this, then we can decide on a plan what we should discuss with Mark Baldwin.

Thanks in advance.
