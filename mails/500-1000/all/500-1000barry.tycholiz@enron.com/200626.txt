David, I just received a call from Mark Whitt and Paul Lucci.  They have been advised by there banks that the cheques being deposited today will take 4 days to clear.  Although you have indicated that there are no issues related to these funds..... I am contacting you to see if there is any way to either authorize the wire immediatly or provide for a faster solution.  Thanks in advance and if you are able to do so, communicate response and cc me as required.    BT
