Chris, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?  It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term. ( winter Gas).  You would think that they would be fine with loading up on Enron. Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!! 

With regards to a meeting.... I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. 

I think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal.  I will call you today.

I called Bill Gaines of Puget to try to relax our credit constraints.  We just traded voicemails, but agreed to talk on Monday.  My general message, unless you have something to add or subtract, will be: "lots has gone on at both companies, makes sense to get together to meet your team to talk about gas and power - probably is more we can be doing together, etc. meeting in late Nov/early Dec".  

Thoughts?
