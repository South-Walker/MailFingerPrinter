Mike, this was that item I wanted to talk to you about... I assume Kim got to you first. 

I appreciate your response... It is extremely important that we maintain the highest quality of service to the wholesale customers where we have MSA's or full requirements arrangements and obligations.  

Thanks, BT

We need to protect the flows to Citizens on TW.  I know you guys have been working on this, but Citizens continues to receive cuts.  Please secure the supply off of TW.  Let Sempra know that IB Link gas will not do.

Thanks,
Mike
