Mike, for your info... we just received this message from IGS re: DWR purchases.  As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...

It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.

Barry,

Interstate Gas Services, on behalf of the DWR, will be soliciting bids for
gas supply.  We are currently contemplating limited gas purchases, and would
like to get a GISB in place.  We would like to do a quick follow up in
regards to the status of the GISB contract between yourselves and the
Department of Water Resources.  If your legal department has any questions
or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at
925-243-0350.

To address any credit concerns you may have, the department is currently
preparing a complete credit package which we will forward to you upon its
completion.

Again, please do not hesitate to call.

Thank You,
Brenda Buxa
Contract Administration
