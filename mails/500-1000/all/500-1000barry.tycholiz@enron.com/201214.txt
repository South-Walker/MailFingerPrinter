Further to our conversation, pls release $ 1,004,000 US funds to the Canadian Orig Desk Head, Eric Ledain. 

These funds will come out of the prudency account that has been set up to distribute these payment obligations.

Gerald, I would like to raise a confirm between ENA and ECC that stipulates why we are paying them these amounts. 

Total payment was in consideration of ECC syndication of PCHC and Misako of which the granted amount on Misako was $ 200,000 .


If there are any questions, give me a call.
