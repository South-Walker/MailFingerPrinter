I am still here and probably will be here until atleast the end of Feb.  I have had to lay off about 5 of 12 people which includes outright termination ot allocation to the estate( clean up, bucket brigade ).  I have been designated to go to the NEWCO which is the trading and marketing core asset business that will be sold lock stock and barrel to a Wall Street firm.  It is looking ok at this time and we will find out in the next couple of weeks what happens.  

We are still planning to be home for christmas and plan on seeing you guys... somehow. 

Talk to you soon. BT

If you get this e-mail I take it you are still there? What's your status. 
I swear I saw you on nightline at the pink slip party.
