Jessica, pls book a room and send a notice to Jane Tholt, Stephanie Miller, Phillip Allen, Beck Cantrell.  Get us a room at 11:30 pls.




Further to our conversation yesterday, Phillip has asked that we meet today to update him on the general and specific efforts related to regulatory concerns on El Paso pipeline.  

Pls be prepared to discuss the major items we had identified last session and what our position and repsonse is planned to be.
