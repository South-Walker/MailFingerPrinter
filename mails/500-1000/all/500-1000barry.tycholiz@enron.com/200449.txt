Mark, Dave, I talked to Lavorato regarding a non-compete... he was fine with proceeding to negotiate a commercial deal but did not want us to commit to a non compete ( just yet) for these reasons.

1. He wants to not restrict EES in their abilities to market in that region ( I will discuss with Delainey).
2. Unless we have an exclusive he thinks we are boxing ourselves.

Pls digest these points as you proceed and keep me posted on where Cascade is even with the paper we showed to them.
