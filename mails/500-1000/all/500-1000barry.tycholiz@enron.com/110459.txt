We are probably to late for that... I believe we have enough paper to address 
including agency agreements which address confidentiality.. I am conducting 
my efforts in good faith and a expeditious fashion.... If we cannot resolved 
a good portion of the paper by the end of business today, there is a 
possibility that this thing dies anyways.
