Barry,

We would like to set a time when Dave Kistler is back in town to discuss our list of companies that we would like to pursue along with your guidance.  Dave will be in town Nov 6th-7th, therefore, I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to meet with us for 30min-1hour. Please advise on your availability.

Thanks so much for you time last week and we look forward to working with you in the future. 


Jenn McClain
