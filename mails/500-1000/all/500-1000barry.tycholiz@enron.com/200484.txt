Good morning... Tim Belden ( Trading) and Chris Calger ( Origination) are in charge of all power issues in the West U.S.  I would also think Paul Kaufman may already have a hand in these issues ( if PUC related ).

New Mexico is starting to reinvent their electric restructuring rules.  Do you know if ENA has any interest in this or who I should check with? Thanks
