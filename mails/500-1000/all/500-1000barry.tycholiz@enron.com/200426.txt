Hello Barry,

My name is Todd Neugebauer and I am a manager in EBS Wholesale Origination in Europe.  I came over here as an associate in February and was promoted in June.  I am looking to move back into one of our more core areas and Ted Bland recommended I speak to you, or someone in your group.  If you have a need, I am going to be in Houston late next week and would be able to meet then to discuss any opportunities.

Regards,

Todd

Randy Maffet would be a good reference, if needed.
