There is a second document that Stacey was working on that is pretty much 
identical as the Monthly firm deal but involves only gas on Alliance called 
AOS ( this is like Interuptable gas, but a little different ). The confirms 
has been raised previously, and you should have this on file. 

This is the file name on the bottom of Stacey's last document.  
o:\\common\\legal\\sdickson\\agreements\\crestarspotcnfm.doc. 

Let me know... 

PS . did you send the confirm to Crestar on the firm volumes. BT
