Subject:	Cost of Funds

As we are all aware ENA structuring is applying a Cost of Funds to all transactions that have a '"cost of funds" implication.  The issue that has surfaced is that the COF is only applicable to originated transactions and not to deals done at the desk level.  This has primary concerns for the mid-market effort.  Due to the noise that was occurring around this topic Joe Deffner suggested that we all get together with him to discuss.  He is available 10/3/01 before 11:00.  Are you interested and available at 9:30 am (today) to participate ?
