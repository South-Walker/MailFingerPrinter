Jay, do we have copy's of all the executed documents... and if so, where are you going to put them. 
Also, did we change the counterparty names in the system and put in offsetting transactions with SOCAL etc.... and new positions with PG&E.  These need to go into the system. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS.
