Mark and Barry

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.
