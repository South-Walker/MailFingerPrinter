Heh.... What's going on.. I was talking to Kevin the other day and he asked how you were and I soon realized that I never called you back to take you up on the beer.

Are you around this weekend.. I have tickets for the Golf tournament... for Friday and Sunday, was thinking of going. Any interest.. I will probably go sunday a.m.

Drop me a line...

PS... work is OK, I think we will be fine..every day is a new day but overall, my guys tell me we will be alright.
