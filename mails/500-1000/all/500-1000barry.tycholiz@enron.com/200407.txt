Jaime, further to our conversations earlier. I look forward to our proposed meeting and will coordinate efforts with Stephanie Miller to prepare for ENA's discussion items.  I have decided for at least the next week or so to defer my travel plans ( I am not the best flyer at the best of times ).. As such, we should work towards the end of the month as a timeline for us to come down. 

We can nail down specific dates soonest.
