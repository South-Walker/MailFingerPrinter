Never did... but glad we were here to ensure it was captured.

Good job.  I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much.

Louise, further to our meeting last week, the contracts have been executed and the Rockies transportation has been sold to CMS. Origination and trading participated in the P&L.  Orig = $ 1,045,000.  Trading approx $310,000. 

We are a little closer to our Q3 targets of $ 2MM in sept.  

Please call if there are any questions.
