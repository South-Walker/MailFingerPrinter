Bill, as part of our conference call this a.m.... please have Debbie identify the top 20 companies that we have out of the money positions to and that we would want to assign in the money deals to. Included in this list we must know the contractual terms of these counter parties including, company name, collateral threshold limits, collateral posted, type of contract ( gas or power ...etc.) Physical or financial. Master Netting... 

In addition to this, we must determine if we can cross pollinate agreements... I.E... a gas agreement is used to offset a power position or vice versa.

Lot's of questions but to start, let's get your list of " Co's who are seeking collateral from us today" and fill in some of these blanks. 

Thanks, BT
