Basically the intent of this condition is as follows:  On the replacement 
gas, we will purchase or sell this gas based on a GDDI but in the event that 
this index is unavailabe at the time of the transaction or the index has 
separated from the fixed price for that day then the counterparties have 
agreed that we can buy/sell on a fixed price.  In either scenerio, when ECC 
is acting as the agent, we shall be held harmless from a price exposure..


If this explanation is not clear enough... give me a call.
