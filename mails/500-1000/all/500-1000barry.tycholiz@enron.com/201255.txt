Judy, attached is a summary report I received from Enron. Please disregard the information I had submitted in the organizer.... as it is incomplete.  I gave up on that system because I was unable to put in decimal points... 

This is the complete list of ENRON Corp stock that I sold in 2000 and has all the relevent information on it.  

Call if there are any questions.  BT

Barry --

Attached is a report that I have access to which may be helpful.   These are actually the exercise confirmations that you should have received when you exercised.

Hopefully this will help.

Mary, I was given your name from my HR rep out of Canada. I am looking for a report that supports my income tax filings in Canada and the US related to options that I exercised in Canada last year.  

Can you please advise.
