Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Thanks, BT
