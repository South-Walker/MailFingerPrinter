BT - Pardon my spelling.... I like to think its more of a typing issue, however.  

Regarding uranium:

Prices for oxide (mined material) are up from a low of $7.10 last December to a new high this month of $9.20 (still low by historical standards).  Perhaps more important though, fuel cycle components (conversion & enrichment) are very strong.  Conversion at $5.00 up from $2.20, enrichment at $105.00 up from $80.00.  These fuel cycle components are required to turn ore into fuel. - DF

PS - Spell check shows no mispelling here.
