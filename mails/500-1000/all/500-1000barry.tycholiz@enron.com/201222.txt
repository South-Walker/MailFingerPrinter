Sorry, I was unable to catch up to you on the weekend.  Look forward to hearing about Austin.  My grandmothers prayers are on tues night. I will be home on Weds. around 6;00 and then off to San Fran and L.A. on thurs/ Friday.  What are the plans for the weekend ?  I might need a raise if I am going to Jet around the country like a rock star.. 

Anything in the markets that I should be aware of ? 

Talk to you later.
