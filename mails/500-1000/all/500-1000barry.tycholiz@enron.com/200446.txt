Make sure we charge the proper cost of funds ( int. rate ) for basically putting money out the door for the deal.

For your reference, please find attached a short presentation that we have prepared for Xcel regarding blend & extend products (a.k.a. stack & roll).  As prices continue to drop and these deals become more attractive, these slides might be useful in our customer presentations.  

Please note that, since this particular presentation is for Xcel, we have included some Rockies fundies information that may or may not be applicable to other customers.  Let me know if you have any questions.
