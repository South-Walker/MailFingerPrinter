Dave, I have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice, we will suspend interviews and discussions.  Louise does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time, priorities lie elsewhere! 

Pls contact me if there are any questions, otherwise can you coordinate with Karen Buckley ( et al ).  Let's re-visit program in mid-december.

regards,

Barry Tycholiz
