High .....merry christmas.  Thanks for the note.  Sorry for the delay in replying.  My blackberry does not work in Canada believe it or not.  I was on the phone with tech help....and we discovered this...what a pain.

Hope the holidays have treated you well... I am planning on going to work on. Weds but from what I hear not much going on.  Still a few co's kicking tires....

Keep you posted as I hear.  Cheers, BT.....m
