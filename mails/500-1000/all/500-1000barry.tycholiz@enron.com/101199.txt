Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a 
seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal.

Thanks.
