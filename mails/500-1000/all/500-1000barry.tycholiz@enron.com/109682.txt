For your info... we have been made aware that the TSA has been amended from 
3,081 to 3,000.  We have contacted Kern and they have advised us that there 
was a volume allocation problem ( I.E. mistake ) and that the correction 
warranted a reduction in the amount allocated capacity. I have formally 
expressed our concern with this and although they apologised for the 
inconvenience no increase will probably be forthcoming.  They are getting 
back to me!

Pls confirm with your companys to verify the volume that was allocated and 
advise if it is anything different than 3,000 to 3,081 mcf.   Also, this will 
reduce the amount of guarentee required. 

Stephanie/Mark... can you review the receipt points and confirm that you are 
OK with these and that we will proceed with these points in the agreement.
Gerald, further to our conversation, we await Corps initials on the guarantee 
as discussed and If there is any issue's associated with this then I would 
like to here asap... please advise.
