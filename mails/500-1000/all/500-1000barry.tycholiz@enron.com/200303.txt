Fred, sorry, I am going to cancel out on you this weekend.  I am currently in 
Canada attending a funeral. and will not be back in the office until Thurs. 
a.m.  and then I am off to San Fran and L.A. on friday... I might either 
slide into Tucson for the weekend and visit a friend or hook-up with lavo in 
vegas.  Not to sure which but want to take a few holiday days out west while 
I can.  

If there is any costs associated with this late notice, I will be more than 
happy to pay my share.  

regards,  BT wi
