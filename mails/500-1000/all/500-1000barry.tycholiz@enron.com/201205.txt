Further to our conversations, I would like to meet with you guys to discuss Q1. Specifically, I would like Stephanie and Kim to provide for me a list of your Q1 activities, achievments, actions items and then summarize your plans for Q2 and rest of year. 

Let's do this as a group first, and then if anyone wants to talk directly about specific commercial issues then we can do so on a one off basis. 

I have asked Jessica  to book 2 hours( video conference room )  for next tues. May 8. 

Pls advise if there are any questions.
