Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest.  You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.   

Paul Lucci ( Denver office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.

Call if you guys want to discuss. 

regard,  BT
