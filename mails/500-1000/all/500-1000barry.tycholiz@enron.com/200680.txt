I think we had discussed this but as a result of security issues accessing the building we will defer until next week our plans.

Thanks, BT

Subject:	We will not be going out with Tych's group

Ina could not get us into the new building tomorrow, so we will not get together after work.  We will plan on going out as a group after we move over.
