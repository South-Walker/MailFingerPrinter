As discussed in the hallways over the last couple of weeks.... getting together is probably a timely item.. Can I suggest a meeting for the end of next week. I will ask my assistant to check calenders and get us all together.(1 hour meeting ). 

Suggestions on topics, issues agenda can be put forward at the first UNION meeting.  


regards, BT
