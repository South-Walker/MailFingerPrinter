Further to our last group meeting.  I have discussed and reviewed the confirmation, deal ticket and data entry process with the appropriate parties and believe that the charts attached provide for a clear understanding of the process we all need to follow.

The transactions start with the originator  and most of the obligation is on you guys to follow up with the paper.  In order that we start to control the output on a more formal basis, we will start by asking to see all paper for deals greater than 31 days....All I am asking is that the confirms desk generate the paper as required, get a copy to the originator and the originator has a OBLIGATION to sign off or make appropriate changes as soon as possible.

The Denver office follows a slightly different procedure as you guys have Theresa to enter deals into Sitara and I know that this effort is coordinated with Carol.  Don't change a thing, just ensure you are comfortable with the paper flow and that if there are any holes that they are filled with a revised procedure. 

Let's see how this process works and re-visit at the end of the year.

If there are any questions regarding this note, pls do not hesitate to contact me.  If you think this note needs to be distributed to other people pls forward as required.
