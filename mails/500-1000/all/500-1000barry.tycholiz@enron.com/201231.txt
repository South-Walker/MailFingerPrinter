The Enron stock that I sold was in US funds.  I then coverted it to Canadian $'s and that is what is on my T4.  The equities that I owned did include Communications System International, and I think that is it.... However, I am travelling and unable to confirm this for you until Apr. 24. or so.

If there are any questions, pls contact me via this address.
