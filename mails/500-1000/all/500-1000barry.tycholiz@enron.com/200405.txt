Assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do? 

I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. 

So, can you pls advise. 

I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a "Stand Still" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.


Current economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.

None of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ). 

Give me a call.
