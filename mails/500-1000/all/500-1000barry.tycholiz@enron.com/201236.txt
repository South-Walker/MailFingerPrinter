Jessica, I will probably not be in on Thurs as I am traveling to Winnipeg for the next few days. 

At this time, I do not have a cell phone number where I can be reached at... but I will get a number to you. 

Please direct my calls accordingly and any messages to my main line. I will check this on a regular basis.

Thanks, BT 

I will call you thurs. a.m.
