Forwarded for your information.  I recall talking with Gregg about this and 
that we did not intend to use the GISB for anything more than one month.  I 
think we agreed to let it sit.

Gregg, here are our special provisions that we would like incorporated into
the Gisb Contract.  I don't believe we are interested in an Enfolio
Agreement at this point, I would prefer to get the Gisb contract executed
first.  Thanks for your help in this matter.
