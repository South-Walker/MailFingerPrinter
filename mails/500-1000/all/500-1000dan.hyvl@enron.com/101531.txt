Bob,
 The Reliant people are only wanting to make changes to the contract between 
Reliant and enovate. the ena/enovate contract was signed a long time ago 
before midwest energy changed their name to enovate.

This makes no sense to me.  What input does Reliant have on a contract 
between ENA and enovate, L.L.C.?

A Master Agreement  for execution has been sent to Ennovate.  Dan Hyvl is 
working with the Chicago office in this matter.   I  understand Reliant 
desires to change some of the terms of the deal and we are waiting to proceed 
pending those changes.
