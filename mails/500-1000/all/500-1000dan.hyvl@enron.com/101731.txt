My time is my own.  I make efficient use of it, and I still have no time for 
reading novels.  If you are inquiring about time that I may have been out of 
the office during the two week period ending today, I was out on Vacation one 
day, that being March 9, 2001.  Any questions?

vacation, sick, personal, jury duty, etc.  Basically, any time not working!  
Thank you!
