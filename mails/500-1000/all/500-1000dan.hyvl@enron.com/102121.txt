I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as 
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back 
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with 
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I 
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no 
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under 
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and 
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob 
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the 
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.
