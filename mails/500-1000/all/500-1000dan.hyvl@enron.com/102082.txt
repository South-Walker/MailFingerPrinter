		 Subject: Re: Mom's Birthday


I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms
that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.
Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know
what to bring and I'll be there.
In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into
a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in
tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt
to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests
and medicines as she needs to.
I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which
requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we
agree is a "safe" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I
feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or
desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not "take control"
of her money...just help her "remember" payment of large purchases. She
still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is
someone "conning" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2
signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.
Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the
day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my
attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3
of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her
maintain her dignity and respect.
OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to
bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so
nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it
won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if
you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe
Christmas? ..Just a thought.
