Not with all of their changes.  We were going back to our original language 
relating to representations and implied warranties.  Otherwise, I believe 
that their language only deleted reference to a Texas law designed to protect 
individuals from big business making improper warranties, i.e. triple damages 
for little guy, big guy only gets his damages.
