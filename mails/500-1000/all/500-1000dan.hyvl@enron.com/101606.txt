Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

Dan,

Attached is the Clark County confirm you made for me with some minor changes 
(volume term price).  Let me know if it still looks OK.

Thanks,

Dave
