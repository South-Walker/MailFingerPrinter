Barry,
 The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on 
ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send 
me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need 
to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it 
out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in 
each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please 
advise.
