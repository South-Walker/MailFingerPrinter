darren,
 This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have 
signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The 
counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general 
partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no 
reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you 
agree?
