I do not think that we can make the determination of which storage or 
transportation agreements may need to be assigned by refering to the 
counterparty name.  Each agreement file will need to be reviewed to determine 
its purpose.  Then depending on its purpose, the agreement will either remain 
with HPLR, ECT, be terminated or assigned, if permitted.  Therefore, please 
have the file room pull the agreements and send them to me for my review.

Dan, 

Could you also please review the listing attached containing 
Transport/Storage deals on the Texas Desk from 1/99 forward to determine if 
any of these companies should be excluded? 

Thank you, 
Melissa
