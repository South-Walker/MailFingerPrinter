As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you 
faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement 
for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel 
that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the 
agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is 
very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out 
by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace 
the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call 
me if you need anything further regarding this matter.
