Susan, 
 That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its 
Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with 
Coral.

Hi Dan,

I have a copy of a letter dated 8/2/99 from ECT to Coral Energy Resources, 
L.P. assigning the referenced contract to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The 
assignment was never made in Global Contracts.

If you agree that it should have been assigned, as the letter says, I will 
assign it today.  If I do assign it, Coral will no longer have a firm master 
contract for trading.  I will also have to remove it from EOL.

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Thanks!
