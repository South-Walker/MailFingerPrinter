Darren,
 If you can get me a copy of the contractual documents that govern the 
physical deals that we are doing with the counterparty, I will modify the 
language to reflect the contractual arrangement that we are relying upon.

Thank you for the quick reply, but I am not sure if this form is applicable. 
The counterparty PSNC Production Corp. is not governed by a Master Physical, 
which this current form references. Is there an open grty. format that can be 
used to cover PSNC's physical business with ENA?
