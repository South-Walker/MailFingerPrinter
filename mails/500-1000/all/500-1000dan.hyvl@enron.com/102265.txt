Jared,
 My only comment is that the three references to Enron North America need to 
be changed to Enron North America Corp.

Dan,

Ned Crady has reviewed a form of this document earlier.  In this OUC specific 
copy, I have included ENA.  Phil DeMoes and I are discussing a potential deal 
with OUC for delivered natural gas into Florida, either via existing 
infrastructure or LNG.  Please review and provide comments.

Jared
