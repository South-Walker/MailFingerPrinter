Blanca,
 I believe that you will need to get this form approved by the legal group in 
Columbus before it is signed.  It is my understanding that Pemex has agreed 
to New York law in the past.  I would not approve it unless they agreed to 
New York law and arbitration conducted in English.  If you need a quick 
turnaround, please check with Gary Prescott.
