Cathy,
 The subject contact that you faxed to me appears to be their standard 
interruptible 311 contract.  t is a month to month interruptible contract.  I 
see no reason why it should not be signed.   Please call me if you need 
anything further.  I will be in the AEP Houston Metro building office 
starting on Monday.
