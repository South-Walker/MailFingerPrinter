=09I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order,=\
 please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signatur=\
e by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available=\
 to handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of i=\
ncumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a=\
 fully executed contract for your files.\
=09Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers =\
of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  =\
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your=\
 transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for gi=\
ving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for i=\
ts actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if=\
 Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto an=\
d Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notific=\
ation, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.=\
  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their r=\
eceipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes. =\
   I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  the OF=\
O provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I can=\
 verify with the transport group.
