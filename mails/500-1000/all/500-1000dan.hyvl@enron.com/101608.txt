Yes if you complete and change "following calendar year" to the "next twelve 
(12) month period".

Thanks Dan,

They have the Master right now, it should be signed today.  I will fill in 
the blanks on Tuesday morning when we hear from the desk.  Given that they 
sign the Master and we agree on terms, can I use this confirm?

Dave

Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

Dan,

Attached is the Clark County confirm you made for me with some minor changes 
(volume term price).  Let me know if it still looks OK.

Thanks,

Dave
