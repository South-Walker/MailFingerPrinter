Susan,
 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me 
you comments as to the suggested changes.
