Bob,
 Please use the language in this version.  I needed to modify to cover where 
we were selling.  Call if you have any questions.

Confirmations

Bob,
 Please review the suggested modifications to be made to the previously sent 
confirmations for the above parties with regard to volumes to be processed at 
the Lowry Gas Plant in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  If you agree, please have 
revised confirmations issued that would be in place of the previously sent 
confirmations.  Please note that I only made changes to the price and 
quantity to reflect the deal as reviewed with Nelson Ferries and Charlie 
Otto.  Please call if you have any questions.
