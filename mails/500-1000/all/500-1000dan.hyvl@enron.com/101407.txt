Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
Ellen
