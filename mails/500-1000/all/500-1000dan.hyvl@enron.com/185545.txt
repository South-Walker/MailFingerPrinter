Carey,
 Please review and notify Richard Sanders and me of any necessary changes.  
Should the letter be from EnronOnline or Enron North America Corp.?  I will 
let Richard put his legalese to the letter before he sends it to Mieco.  
Also, let him know if it should be addressed to someone other than 
T.J.Sattler.
