Molly,
 When you brought me the resumes last week, you indicated that you had 
screened certain of the applicants and that Janette had certain ideals 
concerning the group.  I have had the resumes reviewed by Harry Collins, 
Carlos Sole, and myself and would like your opinion regarding the following 
applicants:

 Vanessa G. Griffin She is the current temp that is filling in for this 
position.
 Mary G. Martinez Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
 Esmeralda Gonzales I believe that Mary Cook has talked to her on more than 
one occasion.
 Sheryle E. Malek
 M. Denise Keauquier
 Maggie Valles
 Mary Lou Browder Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
Additionally, Travis McCullough has been lobbying for us to talk to the temp 
that is currently filling the position for which he has hired his old 
secretary.

 If the foregoing list is okay, we would like to start the interview process 
Wednesday afternoon.  I have suggested to Harry and Carlos, that we jointly 
interview each applicant.  If this is acceptable, I will obtain access to a 
conference room for this purpose.

 Please let me know if there are any problems relating to anyone on the above 
list.
