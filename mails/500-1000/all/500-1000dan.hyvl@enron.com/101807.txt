Kim, 
 As we discussed, I am attaching a copy of the last Transaction Agreement 
that I show has been signed with the City.  Please review and compare it to 
your current proposal.  We can revisit on Monday and I will then generate a 
new Transaction Agreement.

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to 
extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help 
me put together the confirmation?  

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Kim
