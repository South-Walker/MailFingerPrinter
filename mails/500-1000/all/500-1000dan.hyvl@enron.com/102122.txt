THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER

A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to 
kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a 
kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you." She then 
wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 
in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north 
side of the playground. Signed, a blonde." The blonde then pinned the note to 
the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.

The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting 
beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with 
a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow blonde?"
