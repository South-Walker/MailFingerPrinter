> Dear Kids,

>   I am very happy in the new residence you have put me in. This week we
>   actually got to go outside for an hour. I haven't been feeling very good
>   this week, the friend you placed me with died yesterday.  I am coping
>   pretty well with my sorrows.
>
>   It's been two years since you visited me last, I guess you're all pretty
>   busy.  It's OK!  I learned to use the Internet to pass the time. So you
>   can remember what I look like I'm send-ing you a recent picture of 
myself. 
>   I send you this picture with all my love....
