Subject: T-shirt Give Away


	The hip, new HELLO ENRON T-shirt made its debut this week, and employees 
around the world are wondering where they can find one.  You can't buy them, 
but you can win one.  
	
	Here's how: listen to the program and respond to the attached survey.  Every 
employee who answers the five survey questions will be entered in a drawing 
to win one of hundreds of T-shirts that will be given away in September.
	
	To win, submit the survey by September 15 to hello-enron@enron.com or Linsey 
Hasenbank (lhasenb@enron.com).  You may also fax to 713-853-6790 or send to 
EB 4932 in Houston.

There are two ways to listen to HELLO ENRON:

 (1) on your telephone by dialing 713-853-HELO or toll free 1-888-335-0403
 (see home.enron.com for international numbers);

 (2) or on your computer through streaming audio -- visit home.enron.com for

Thanks for listening!
