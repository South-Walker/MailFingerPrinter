Bridgette,
 I am not crazy about the Columbia (Coastal) GISB, can you attach the El Paso 
version for my review?

Dan,

Effective 2/1/01 the above mentioned CP's merged to form El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P.   Both CP's has an acceptable GISB.  Could you please look over 
the GISB for Coastal  (attached) so that we can determine whether to 
terminate this contract?  In case you wanted to view El Paso's GISB, I have 
attached it also.



Thanks,
Bridgette
