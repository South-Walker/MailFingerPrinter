No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204.

I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday.  
Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to 
call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If 
you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is 
resolved, that would be great.

Thanks,

Steve
