Alan, 
 Is this something that someone in your group should respond to?

Andrea Hauser w/EnronOnline called and said that Marathon has a problem with 
the terms of the online GTC's (default language) for LPG, petrochems, and 
refined products and would like to talk to one of our lawyers.   Marathon's 
lawyer is Rhonda Stinemyer and her # is 713/296-2408.  Can you let Andrea 
know who will be handling this.

Thanks.
