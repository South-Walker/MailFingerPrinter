Steve, 
 I concur with your assessment of the proper method of so transferring the 
documents.

Dan,


I think that given that there was a transfer of gas balances on the books 
from HPLR to ECT on 2/1/99, we need to show the transfer of the Operative 
Agreement rights and obligations to ECT first.  We can use the very same form 
to effect a transfer of ECT's interest on to HPL  effective July 1, 1999, 
with an acknowledgment of gas balances Schedule that will reflect the changes 
in each parties balance on July 1, 1999.  I know its more work, but I want it 
to track reality for when we face any investor/bank inquiries.  Let me know 
if your thoughts differ.

Steve
