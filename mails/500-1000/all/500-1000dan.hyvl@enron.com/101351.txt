Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Mike
