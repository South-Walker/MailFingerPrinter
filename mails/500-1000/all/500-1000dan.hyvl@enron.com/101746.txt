Lee,
 Here is the Force Majeure letter to Reynolds.  I know nothing about the 
Union Carbide letter.

Here's a draft of what we need to send to Equistar ....



Do you have hardcopies of two past force majeure letters ....

Reynolds Metals ......  back in 1995 or 1996

Union Carbide ..... last year at Seadrift

Thanks

Lee
