Jeff,
 How would you like me to respond to Linda concerning ENA contracts that are 
being assigned to HPL as a part of Project TripleLux?

Dan,

Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA?  

Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do.

Thanks,
Linda

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?
