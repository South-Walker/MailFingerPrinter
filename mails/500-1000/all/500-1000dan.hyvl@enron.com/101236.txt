Barbara & Anne,
 I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed 
to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred 
to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, 
the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for 
the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, 
transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, 
Joe would like as much up front notice as possible.
