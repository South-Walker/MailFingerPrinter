Kim,
 Let's try to get this signed as soon as possible.  The changes are as we 
discussed.  I will be out Monday, but will be able to approve the final 
version on Tuesday.

Dan,

Attached redline contract compares changes we discussed today to the
document I sent you yesterday.  If changes are acceptable, I will send the
contract to WPS for their review.

Thanks!
Kim
