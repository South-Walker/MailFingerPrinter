Dan,

This looks fine, so if you would like to have your people execute it and
forward it to us, we will execute and close the loop.

Thanks,

Tammi

Attached please find a red-line and clean version of the Confidential
Agreement we discussed this morning.  Please advise if the clean version is
in order and I will have the Credit Group proceed with its execution and
forwarding to Gibson.
