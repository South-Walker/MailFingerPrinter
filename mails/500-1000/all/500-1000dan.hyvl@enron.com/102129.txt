Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.
