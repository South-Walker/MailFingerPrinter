No, They are with two separate entities which each need to stay in place.  Am 
I missing something?

So, would you advise terminating the 10/1/00 agreement effective 3/1/01?  If 
the answer is yes, would we need to send out an letter advising of our 
actions?

Bridgette,
 I would stay with the April 1, 1998 agreement.  The 10/01/00 agreement was 
with the canadian el paso entity.

Dan,

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.
