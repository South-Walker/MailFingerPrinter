Okay, as to 2,5,8.  Can you explain what is meant by "fixed price" in the 
other and what criteria is to be used in fixing the price?

I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm.

With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts 
are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a 
fixed price I am fine with it.
