Pat,   
 Please note that you were able to open this mail without any loud noise.  
Next time i might send something that could open with some type of noise that 
might not stop even if you power off the computer.    But not this time.  

 Please put me down as attending the mark-to-market presentation.  Also, 
Include Stacy Dickson as an attendee.
