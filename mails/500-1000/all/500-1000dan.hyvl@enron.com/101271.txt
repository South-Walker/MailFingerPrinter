Attached please find the modified Transaction Agreement which has been 
revised to reflect the matters you discussed earlier today.  I modified the 
third item relating to prior approval by Ormet of incremental costs to cover 
the situation that such transportation or supply becomes unavailable during 
the period Enron is obtaining Ormet's prior approval.
