Joan,
 Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.  According 
to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is 
the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.  Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is 
identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.  If this 
is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the 
St. Mary's deal.  Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need 
and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.  Please call if 
you have any questions.
