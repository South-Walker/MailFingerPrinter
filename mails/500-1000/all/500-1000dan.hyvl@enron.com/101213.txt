Please explain, confirms are sent out by the confirm desk.  why is this sent 
to legal.  If you send us a credit worksheet, we can prepare a Master Firm 
Purchase Sale Agreement and once it is signed then a confirm can be issued to 
cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the 
confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal 
number is greek.
