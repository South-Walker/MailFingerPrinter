Dan,
 I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase 
agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made 
no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase 
up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads 
"above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please 
review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, 
please call and I will modify.
