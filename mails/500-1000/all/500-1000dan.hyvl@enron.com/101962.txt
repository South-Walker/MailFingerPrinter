Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are having Steve 
Van Hooser work on the Lease Amendment.  Call me if you need anything further.
