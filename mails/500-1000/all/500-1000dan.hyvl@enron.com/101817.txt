Sylvia,
 I have taken Brant Reves comments and incorporated them in the red-line 
mark-up of the EnergyOne Ventures BAC agreement.  Those changes are reflected 
in the attached document.  Please review and let me know if you have any 
further changes which need to be made.  If no additional changes, please 
forward to counterparty for their comments.
