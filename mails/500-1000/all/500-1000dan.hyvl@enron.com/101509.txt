Chris,
 I have reviewed the contract forwarded by Susan Spalding and have made my 
suggested changes which are based on the language required by the Credit 
Group.  Please review these changes which are noted in the red-line version 
that is attached.  If you agree with my suggested changes, let me know and I 
will forward to Susan Spalding for her consideration.
