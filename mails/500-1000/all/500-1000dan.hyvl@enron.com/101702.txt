Kim,
 Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio 
to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded 
to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to 
include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for 
short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, 
we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we 
can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show 
them what we got for the default quantity.
