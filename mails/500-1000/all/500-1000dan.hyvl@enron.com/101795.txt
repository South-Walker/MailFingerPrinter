Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

Dan,

Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take 
a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so 
that we are legally comfortable with it?

Thanks,

Kim
