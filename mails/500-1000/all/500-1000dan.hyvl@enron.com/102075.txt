Sounds good.  We intend to bring the fixings for the burgers, that is , meat, 
onions, lettuce, tomatoes, 16 big buns and 8 small buns.  I think that mom 
has enough mustard and mayonnaise.  If you think we need more buns, let me 
know.  I don't know how many are going to show and eat.  I will leave the 
beans, potato salad, chips and desserts to you and Bettye.

?Sounds great to me. Are you bringing the fixins for the  burgers? Or do you 
want me to get that? I thought Bettye And I could provide  beans and potato 
salad and any desserts. I'm bringing a dewberry pie and another  dessert. I 
think Mom is planning on fixing chicken noodle soup' Buddy saw Mom  today, 
says she was doing real well today. I think maybe working that election  
Saturday was a bit of a strain on her and thats why she seemed so confused  
Tuesday. See you'll Sunday
