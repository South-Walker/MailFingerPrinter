Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.
