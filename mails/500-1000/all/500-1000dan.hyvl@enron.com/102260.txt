Barbara,
 Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at 
any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he 
could resell such gas into HPL.  I explained to him that the EOL carve out 
was for transactions of less than one month.  He asked if you could call him 
if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind 
just calling him to discuss the matter.
