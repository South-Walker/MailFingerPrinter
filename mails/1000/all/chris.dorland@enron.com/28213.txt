Chris, this is a year-end adjustment that will be done for your T4 prior to processing them.  Your final pay stub will stay the same as I cannot go back and re-issue those.

I'm going to use the 18K number we have record of and adjust the balance down.

thanks,

Tricia

Tricia,

Have you looked in to the stock option line item on my pay stub yet? The number on the stub is about 36000 and I think about 18000 is accurate.
