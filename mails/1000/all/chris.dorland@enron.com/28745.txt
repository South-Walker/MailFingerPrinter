Subject: Ricardo Perez Reviewer

Hello to the Houston Gang,

I was mistakenly posted as a reviewer for Ricardo Perez. Either Chris is  
trying to pass himself off as his charming younger brother again or IT has 
messed up our emails on the PEP system.  Please contact IT support:
1-713-853-4777 
so that this gets sorted out.  Let me know if you have any problems.

Chris' brother,

Dan Dorland
