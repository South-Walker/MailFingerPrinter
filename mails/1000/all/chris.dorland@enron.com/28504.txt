Carmax showed me a $29000 bid. I'll sell it to you for $29500.

What are you driving these days? I'm selling my car cheap because it will cost me a fortune to take it back to Canada. 2001 Lexus IS 300 Silver with Black leather interior. Totally loaded with 3800 miles on it. Let me know if you or any of your buddies want to check it out.
