I called the number you gave me and they said that my refund check had been mailed in May. I never received the check and am wondering what to do next? The IRS said they would put a trace on the check and get back to me but that was over a week ago. I was wondering if PWC could look into it for me as you might get further than I have. Please contact me if you need any further info. or with any questions. 

Thank you,

Hi, Chris,

Judy Perdomo is away this week, but she has asked me to provide you with
the number to where you can enquire about your outstanding U.S.
refund...try the IRS Practioners Hotline @ (412) 281-0281.

Best regards,
