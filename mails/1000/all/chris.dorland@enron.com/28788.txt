Jill,

All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading 
power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season 
and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I 
trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. 
Better go but keep in touch!
