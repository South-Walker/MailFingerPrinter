Mike, 

I wish I was there to witness Dan in action. I will be next year for sure. Can't wait to see Johnny. Hopefully there are some single hotties at the wedding. There hasn't been a cougar sighting recently. Better hop. Talk to you later...

Chris

Buddy, 
Things are good.  I am going out for lunch today with our corporate finance group.  I'm thinking of moving down there.  The wedding should be a gong show.  Golf trip to BC was amazing!  Greywolf is quite a track.  How's the stalker?  Still phoning in the odd booty call?  I'm back with mine.....I'm weak.   Good to see your bro - he did some vintage "wheeling" when he was down, it was sweet.  Take care, see you soon.  Johnnie says hi and he is looking forward to seeing you.  Later

Mike, 
What's going on? It is hot as shit down here. I had to get a new # 
because that crazy cougar was stalking me. It is 713-665-8145. Just 
kidding my old phone company went belly up. I am really looking forward 
to Matt and Jen's wedding. I bought a new lampshade to wear. Be sure to 
get Matt all fucked up on the stag. Talk to you later.
