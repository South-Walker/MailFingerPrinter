That is what I thought. Have you heard anything regarding my refund? Did they trace the check? Let me know.

Thanx

Hi Chris,

Just a note to let you know that a tax equalization calculation will not be
prepared for you,,,, in case you were unsure.  This means that the refund
owing to you on the US return is 100% yours - which is good news, right?
