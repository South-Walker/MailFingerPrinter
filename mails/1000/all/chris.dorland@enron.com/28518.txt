Hey,

Just got back from some time off.  Congrats on the house.  Where did you buy?  When are you coming up?  I'll let you know all the details of the offsite as soon as we know - it should be a good time.

What are the details of this offsite? Make sure to count me in. Bought a house this weekend. No sense wasting any time. I'll call you later.
