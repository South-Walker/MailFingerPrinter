Kerrie,

Congratulations! I actually heard the big news last week from Jill (of course) but I have been meaning to drop you a line. I was in town last weekend for Matt and Jen's wedding and while I was there I bought a house in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron. One again congrats and I'll give you a call when I get back to town. 

Chris

Hi Chris,

I hope you are well keeping cool in Houston!  I just wanted to let you know
that Leigh and I got engaged atop Mt Temple last weekend.  I wanted you to
hear it from me.  I would love  to hear from you when you get a chance!!  I
am spending all my time right now deciding on a honeymoon destination!!

I hope all is well.

Kerrie
