Hello-
I am not sure what you have been up to in Canada.. I hope you have been trying to enjoy yourselves.  Have you been keeping track of this?  Can someone in your office send me an accounting of the settles for Nov-Jan (index) and where the market might be for Feb and March.
 
Thank you and knd regards,
Caroline

Hi Caroline,

Any chance of getting a price quote on the Sumas/Malin swap?
