Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris
