Thanks.  Appreciate the concern.  Hopefully most of this will be legal time & $ but one never knows.

Just a thought for you - I can assure you,  based on the experience in the Ontario market with other retailers, that the more Enron Direct uses independent sales channels (i.e. direct mail, telemarketing, door to door),  the compliance issues (ie. compliance by the independent sales forces with applicable codes of conduct and consumer /business practices legislation) will mushroom.  It could eat up a lot of regulatory staff time.
