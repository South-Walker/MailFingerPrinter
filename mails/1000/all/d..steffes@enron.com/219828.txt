Jim - Attached are two documents.  The IRTF will give you a picture of whta is being done in the region with respect to my direct reports.  The second document reflects the business opportunities that I am currently working on with ENA and various companies.  As always please don't hesitate to call should further discussion be needed. Thanks and sorry for the delay SM
