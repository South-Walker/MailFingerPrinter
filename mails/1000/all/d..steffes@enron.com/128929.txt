Thanks.  I guess Davis' people think that we'll back off if they put someone from Texas in charge.  Perhaps they're looking for someone who knows Pat Wood.  Be useful to find out if she knows him.
 
Best,
Jeff

Jean --
 
Laura Doll has been appointed head of the CA Power Authority.  Do you know her?  It would be good to have an introduction for Jeff Dasovich.
