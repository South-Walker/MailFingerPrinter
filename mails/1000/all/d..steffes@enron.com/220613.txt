Please advise if you prefer this format, or you think that percentage change in price is more meaningful.

Amr - Here are the charts I have been working on for forward gas/power prices.  Please take a look at them and let me know your suggestions on any way we may improve upon them.  I have played with it a bit in power point, but excel really does work better for a number of reasons.
