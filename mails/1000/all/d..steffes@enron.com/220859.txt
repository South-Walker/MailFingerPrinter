Dear Family & Friends,
 
We just wanted to tell you that our previous internet provider  went bankrupt so, therefore, we have a new home email address.    
 
Our home email address is: jbirt@attbi.com 
 
Janet's work email remains: janet@oiumreyen.com 
 
Jim's work email remains: james_birt@amat.com 
 
Please be sure to update your address books as we wouldn't  want to lose touch with any of you.
 
Love,
 
Jim & Janet Birt
