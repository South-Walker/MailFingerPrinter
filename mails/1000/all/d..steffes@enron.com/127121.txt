Next Steps --

1.	Leverage EES Customers Signing Post August 25 Contracts

The language in SB78 continues to hold the date for suspending DA as August 25.  EES signed a number of very large contracts that benefit important in-state businesses.  We are trying to establish a strategy around the following segments:

a)	California Restaurant Association
b)	CMTA via the Aerospace Industry 
c)	Wal-Mart.

We need all of our customers to call (a) the Governor, (b) the key Legislative members, and (c) their trade associations.  Leveraging the trade associations is critical given CMTA's support for the bill.  We can release (very quietly) to influential persons Wal-Mart, Raytheon, and Northrop.

It is also critical that we try and contact someone from Boeing to get their read of the bill and its impact.  Our understanding is that they have recently signed a deal with another marketer and will be cut out by this Bill.  Any help in communicating with Boeing is critical.

Please let me know how best to approach the Calif Rest Association.  What should we do?  Is it better to have our customers call?

I will work up some talking points and phone numbers with Sue Mara to use in these discussions.

2.	Fight the CPUC on Retroactive Order

Sue Mara is working through AReM to convince the CPUC that their Proposed Decision would be illegal.  Continue to push on this front.  

Thanks,

Jim
