Maine Electric Consumer Cooperative ("MECC") & Competitive Electricity Services ("CES")
					vs.
Central Maine Power Company ("CMP") & Bangor Hydro Electric Company (BHE)


Just this morning, I was forwarded paperwork on a notice of a hearing that was held on Dec-03, 2001.  Per Jim Steffes, you have seen this complaint come by your desk.  However, I will forward you a hard copy of what I have in hand.  

In its allegations in the Complaint CES & MECC alleged that Enron intends to breach its contractual obligations to CES & MECC by failing to remit to them their Administrative Fee collected from Customers under their contracts with Enron.

Hard copies of the Complaint on the way.
