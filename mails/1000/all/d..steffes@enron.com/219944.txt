Subject:	Billing Dispute Complaints

Contrary to what we expected, Enron's Billing Dispute Complaint against SCE
has been assigned to Commissioner Duque and ALJ Timothy Sullivan.  Although
the complaint against PG&E has not been officially assigned, I would expect
it to follow suit.  Both SCE's and PG&E's answers to the complaints are due
on October 17th.
