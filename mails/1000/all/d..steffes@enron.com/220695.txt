P.S. Just for your information, I will summarize the Independent System Operator Proposal made by Southern - it evolved during the Mediation process but it retains the concept of National Grid being the Transco/RTO

Mike --

Ashley Brown called to discuss a meeting with the Stakeholders in Columbus, OH on either Dec 4 or Dec 5.  He would like our participation.  Also, he would like us to let our friends in the industry know about this upcoming meeting.

Thanks,

Jim
