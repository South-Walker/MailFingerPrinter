Sounds good.  Maybe we can employ the Gov one last time before the end of the year to try and message a "workable" solution --  let's just decide what that is (maybe some bare minimums on RTOs)?

Jim,

Just to let you know, Ray and I spoke with Marc Racicot today about WestConnect and the problems associated with the filing made on Ocotber 15.

We emphasized the problems with overall lack of independence, lack of resolution on congestion management and market monitoring despite a four year process to do so.  We also touched on significant participating transmission operator involvement in the planning and interconnection process as well.

Mr. Racicot seemed very appreciative of our comments and noted that many of the governors he speaks with still do not have a full understanding of the implications of forming an RTO and will typically follow the path of least resistance.  Having been made aware of our concerns will help him better craft his message to this group.  He is interested in receiving any bullet points or summaries of any filing we make in regards to WestConnect.

Kind Regards,

Dave
