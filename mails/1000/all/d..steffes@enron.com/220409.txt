Right now I'd let the FERC make that call.  If asked, Enron believes that incorporating Fla into the Southeast makes great sense for Florida consumers - more access to low cost markets, etc.  Why is the fight ours?  Let's keep it alive before FERC but not make it a big push for Enron.

Jim - What is your position regarding Fla in the SE RTO?  Do we want to fight the fight with the Fla. PSC or are we willing to accept Fla as a stand alone at this point, and let things sort out in the rest of the SE first.  I believe Staines thinks that we will lose ground in Fla rolling them up into the SE RTO?  I probably agree with that statement and also believe we will rattle the Fla PSC's cage with little or no chance of winning the argument.  Thoughts? SM
