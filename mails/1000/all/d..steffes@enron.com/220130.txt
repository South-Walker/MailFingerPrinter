Who at Reliant said this???  I'd let them go forward and we'll do our own.

Subject:	Reliant to do cost benefit study

Marchris said that Reliant is going to do an RTO cost benefit study for the SE.  I have not contacted Reliant.

We may want to think about whether we continue to do our own or consider going in with Reliant.
