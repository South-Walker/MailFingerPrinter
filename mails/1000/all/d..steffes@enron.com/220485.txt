We're testing the first edition of the conversion of the Project Tracking database in it's evolution from Notes to Oracle.  I'd like to meet with the two of you to make sure we're still interested in the current structure and purpose.  If we want to make changes/enhancements to the system, it's most efficient to do it now while we're still in development.  By copy of this message, I'm requesting that Gus coordinate with Ginger and Linda to schedule some time for us to review the system during the first or second week of September.

Thanks!
