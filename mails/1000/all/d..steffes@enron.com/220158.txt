Do all REPs have to report this information - including our customer complaints?  Even if we only serve non-PTB customers?  Who is tracking this internally assuming we have to file it?  Do the business people understand this obligation?

Subject:	PUCT Reporting Requirements - FINAL

Attached is the final report requirements and reporting template to be used for the draft report to the PUCT on October 31st and the November 15h report to be filed with the PUCT.  I had provided due dates in the previous email, but please have the October 31st information to me so I can send to the PUCT by 2:00 p.m., October 30th.  I would like to have the November 15th report by COB November 12th so we can properly prepare the filing.  Thanks.
