I didn't know/remember you were here. They are still closed, but I'll see if I can reach him.  Another option: we're sponsoring this Alliance to Save Energy dinner that night and we still have room at our table, if Keith and you want to go.  Pataki gets an award.   It should be an ok time.

I'll try to raise him and let you know.  When do you get in?
