Not really.  I tried to get to talk to her but never could get an opportunity.

Jim--Arnetta McRae, a commisioner from Delaware, will be on the RtO panel on Thursday.  We don't have any relationships with her, but I know that she was at the GENIE event in D.C. last week.  Did you get any sense of where she is on the RTO issues, other than she felt slighted that FERC didn't pay attention to her and the other commissions?
