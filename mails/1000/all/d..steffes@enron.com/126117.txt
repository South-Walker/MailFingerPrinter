I would like to have a meeting today at 4pm to review the work that West Power URM has been working on to compare the economic impact of the 4 alternatives.  

It would also be good to get any other feedback from the meetings with SCE and other relevant activities.

I will ask my assistant Linda Noske to get a call in number and a room on 47.

Please let Linda Noske know if you will attend.

Jim
