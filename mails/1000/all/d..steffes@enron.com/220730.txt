Jim,

Paul ok'd this but wanted me to get approval from you too.  I made these travel plans about 3 weeks ago (seems like a year ago).

Paul,

I am unclear about travel policy at this point:

I need to go to CAISO  market issue forum (aka MIF)  and a 3-RTO conference on market monitoring on Th, Fri in Sacto, SF respectively.  Sue M could go to former but wouldn't be the best for the latter.

Total savings if I do not go (i.e., net of cancellation fees): ~$400

OK to go?
