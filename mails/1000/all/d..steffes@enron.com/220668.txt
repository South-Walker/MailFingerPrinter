Rick called Lynne Church to discuss maybe having EPSA put out daily "papers" on market issues.  EPSA did this at the FERC RTO Week and it worked very well.

Jim -- I'll call Samantha Slater to see if she has already begun drafting a talking-point paper.  It seems a natural adjunct to the "lively debate" she envisions in Philadelphia during the NARUC meeting.

Also, we should have a talking point response to the NARUC points (would be good to come from EPSA).

Sue & Kerry -

Do you know if anyone is going to this?  Should we work with EPSA to publish an EPSA piece that corresponds to this?

Dear Interested Parties:

Please find attached the final draft of NARUC's National Electricity Policy. We are providing you with this document as a courtesy. Our goal is to
review and debate the policy at the NARUC Annual Meeting in Philadelphia and to approve a policy that provides members of Congress and other federal policy makers a summary of NARUC's position on federal energy policy and legislation. We look forward to a lively debate in Philadelphia.

Sincerely,
Judy Jones, Co-chair
Edward Garvey, Co-chair
NARUC's National Energy Policy Committee
