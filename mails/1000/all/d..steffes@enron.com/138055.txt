Subject:	RTO cost benefit analysis

Per Jim, Enron is going to participate in EPSA's cost benefit analysis for the SE RTO.  Mirant and possibly others have said that they will perform a cost benefit analysis for the Midwest.  We are not going to participate in those.  (Please keep in mind that Enron did the "natural markets studies" for the SE and the NE).  Thanks.
