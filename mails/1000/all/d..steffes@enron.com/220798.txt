Julie --

Given our current situation at Enron, I wanted to let you know that we will not be able to support the SE RTO Study.  I assume that you were already thinking this.  This upcoming week should prove to be another amazing ride.  

As soon as we come up for air, I'll call and fill you in on the developments.

Thanks,

Jim
