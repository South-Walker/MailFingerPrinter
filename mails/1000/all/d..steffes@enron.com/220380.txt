Jim,

	I gave Karen Denne a printed copy yesterday and asked for her response.  I have not received it yet, so I plan to bug her on Monday.  When I talked to the editor, I found that PacifiCorp had been asked to write an article in favor of RTO, so there is confusion about what to do with my article.  They also have to drum up funds to publish each issue of the magazine, so I sent them to Kaufman, who got me into this.  I will keep you posted.

Steve

Has PR given the go ahead?  Anything else from me needed?
