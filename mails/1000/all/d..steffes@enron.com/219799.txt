Subject:	California CMTA Info - Friday Conference Call (Boeing Comments)

FYI - RE: your statement this morning about Boeing, Raytheon indicated this morning, that on last Friday's conference call with California Manufacturers & Tech. Assn., Boeing told the lobbing group at CMTA they had to prevail with an 8/31/01 retro date and it was apparent that APS ES was their supplier....CLECA probably has the same marching orders from Boeing if they are still members there...
