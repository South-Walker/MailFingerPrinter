Vicki --

I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that "passes thru" congestion.  There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.  Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.  I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?

Who should I talk with?
