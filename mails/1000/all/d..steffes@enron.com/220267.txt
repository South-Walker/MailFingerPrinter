Jim & David,

Here is the info for the Finance Day on September 14th.  Phil Polsky, Associate, has revived confirmation from Chip Schneider and someone from his group in RAC to present at the Lunch.( I will forward those details as soon as I have them).  We are still needing someone to talk on the Panel.  Someone had suggested Kirk Nuener, I think he needs some convincing.  

Thank you for your help.  I will keep you posted.

Paul L./ Recruiter
