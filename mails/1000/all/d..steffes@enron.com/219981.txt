Sue and Jeff --

I am having a meeting with Vicki and Janet Dietrich on Thursday to discuss our view on the ability to extend our current contracts in CA (for customers already on DA).  Can we discuss this today or soon thereafter.

My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.  Any news on how SCE and SDG&E will move forward?

Thanks.
