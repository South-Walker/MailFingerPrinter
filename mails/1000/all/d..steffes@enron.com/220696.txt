Luiz -

Please get internal comments from Thane Twiggs, Sue Mara, Steve Walton, Dan Staines, and Dave Perrino before letting Doug go public with this document.  I want to make sure that we are correct in some of our analysis (for example, I think that you may have misinterpreted the FERC in the California discussion).

Christi, Mike:

As per your request, please find enclosed my first draft of the Balanced Schedules White Paper - to be used by Doug  in Ercot.

If you think the graphs help illustrate the points, they should be inserted and cross-referenced as part of the chapter " can reliability be jeopardized if balanced schedules are abadoned"? (cross-reference is relative straightforward as graphs as described in the text)
