Janine -

Ok for you to cover the whole country.  I had forgotten our discussions.  Please discuss NM and AZ with Leslie Lawner.

Originally I was, but then I thought you wanted me to cover the west as well, so I have talked to Paul and to Jean in order to complete the picture for the US.  If you would prefer that I stick to the east and midwest, that's fine, just let me know.

Leslie --

It's my understanding that Janine is just reviewing the Eastern US.  If I'm wrong, Janine please correct me.

Thanks
