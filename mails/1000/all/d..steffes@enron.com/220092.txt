Mike --

I'd shorten the letter to one page by simply referencing the State Commission's letter and issues.  Don't we want to also work on pushing a Mediation (or some other solution) right now?

Donna --

Pls check with Linda R. about filing.  It's important but let's make sure our overall FERC strategy is consistent.

Jim, attached is a draft letter to Pat Wood.  It is basically the same letter sent by the State Commissions and consumers groups today....if we are to send it, it needs to go out this afternoon probably by 3pm (i don't know the process, Donna could you help....).

regards
Mike
