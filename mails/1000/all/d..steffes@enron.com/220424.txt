Hello Jim,

Our Department is planning a Recruiting Offsite.  With this offsite we would like to include our Executive Team Leads.  

Had a couple of questions to ask:

1)  Would you be available for our recruiting kick-off meeting on September 5, from 2-5?
2)  Would you be willing to come to Jillians or would they rather stay close to the building, there is a reception that would follow.

If you are available please save the date.

Please let me know.  

Paul L./Recruiter
