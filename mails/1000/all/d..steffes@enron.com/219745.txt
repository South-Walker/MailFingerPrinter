Rick --

Any insight into this statement about Whalley and Frevert?  I'm guessing that this is just Lay's vision of what is now impacting our company?  Appreciate your thoughts?

   Lay wasn't more specific about the two men's assignments.
     ``They'll be looking at all of the businesses -- the
wholesale unit, government affairs. Anything that affects Enron,''
Lay said.
