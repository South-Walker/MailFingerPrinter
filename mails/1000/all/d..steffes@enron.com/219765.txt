RE: Conference Call on FERC NOPR on Revised Public Utility 
      Filing Requirements
      ?Friday, September 7th at 2:30 p.m.

On July 26th, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing to replace its current filing requirements for short- and long-term service agreements with an electronically-filed Index of Customers, among other changes.  Comments are due to FERC on or before October 5th.  On August 8th, EPSA sent out a memo briefly summarizing the Order and identifying some possible issues of concern.  If you have any additional issues, please forward them to Jackie Gallagher at jgallagher@epsa.org.

We will hold a conference call on Friday, September 7th at 2:30 p.m. to discuss issues for possible comments on the NOPR.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please contact Jackie Gallagher at 202-628-8200.
