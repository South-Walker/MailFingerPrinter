Kevin --

Eddy Daniels is interested in coming over to UBS Reg Affairs.  He is currently in ENA Legal working primarily on M&A activities (worked last year on Cuiaba and has been working on the UBS deal).

I would like you to meet him.  He is very interested in coming over and helping out.  Will take a little educating, but I think that he can get up to speed quickly and will definitely be someone that can help us through the start-up work.

Can you talk with him tomorrow or Friday?

Jim
