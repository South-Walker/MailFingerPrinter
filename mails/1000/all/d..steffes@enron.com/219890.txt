Jim, I talked to Jan Acton not an hour ago and he was hoping to get the info out this evening.  I confirmed your e-mail address to him.  I will call again to see how he is doing.  Ray

Michael -

I've asked the outside consultants to give us a % change for the impact of the refund case.  Try to give these to you asap.  Ray Alvarez will you please follow up with CRA and Jan Acton?

Thanks,

Jim
