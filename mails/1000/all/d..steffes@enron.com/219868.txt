Hey there Jim.  I'm glad you made it back in one piece.  I'm sure your wife=\
 was frantic. =20\
\
FYI:  This past week-end, Becky and I attended NESA's annual conference.  O=\
ne of the highlights was a panel entitled "Power Deregulation."  On the pan=\
el:  Brad Williams, Sr. VP, Entergy Wholesale Operations;  Michael Schneide=\
r, Director, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E); Steve Gillialand, Sr. VP, Du=\
ke Energy North America, LLC; and Jerry Winter, VP, Reliant Energy Services=\
.  Note: Loretta Lynch, President, CPUC was scheduled to participate on the=\
 panel as well, but she was a no-show.  My guess - she chickened out.  It w=\
as probably for the best because everyone on the panel "slammed" California=\
, the Governor, and the CPUC.\
\
I had the opportunity of questioning Michael Schneider (I asked these via n=\
ote cards) of SDG&E in regards to Open Access and where did it look like th=\
e legislature was going with it and what was SDG&E's position.  On record, =\
he said that open access will pass through legislature but that it would be=\
 "segmented."  For example, depending on the size of the customer would dep=\
end on if they can participate in regards to open access.  The Large custom=\
ers can have the opportunity to participate in open access but supposedly b=\
ecause the smaller customers "aren't really educated" on the issues of open=\
 access, they won't be able to participate.  (Sounded rather patronizing to=\
 me, even if he was rather pleasant.)  How does SDG&E feel about open acces=\
s?  He said that they're definitely in favor of  open access and feel that =\
it is needed but only for large customers and that the smaller customers ar=\
en't "quite ready" for open access because again lack of education.  Suppos=\
edly the smaller customers aren't sophisticated enough I guess.\
\
Jim, question - is this something everyone on the Ca. calls already know in=\
cluding you or should I send this out to others as a "FYI" ?\
