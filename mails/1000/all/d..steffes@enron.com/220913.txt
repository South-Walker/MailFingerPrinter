It is my understanding, as much as anyone knows it today, that between now and January 2, 2002, we do not have to post any collateral or other payments (other than payment for commodity) to keep contracts we want to keep alive.

Dan and Janet are meeing with McMahon today at 2:00 to discuss our overall strategy.  Can you confirm back to me the above comment.

Thanks

Wade
