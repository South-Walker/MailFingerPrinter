Not quite sure who/what ponderosa is but we have sandhill Austin of which we control 100 MW thru Oct 03. We also have assorted asset management deals but they amount to advisory roles. We did have a deal in the works with the Cleburne Facility that was formerly owned by Tenaska. Carl Tricoli is your man on that one.

Met with Charles yesterday and outlined what I saw as needs and opportunities. He said he will be getting back to you on it.

Take care,

Doug

I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  

The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
  
Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
Do we have any construction in progress?  
Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?

Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?

Thanks,

Jim
