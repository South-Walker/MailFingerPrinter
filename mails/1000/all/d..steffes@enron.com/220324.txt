As we discussed and per your request, the attachment entitled ECAR, MAIN, MAPP contains my recommendation and reliability council contacts for replacing me on various committees and panels.  

The attachment entitled Sprint contains information regarding the termination of the Enron cell phone.

On Wednesday, I will terminate all phone service associated with the Enron Bismarck office.  

Please contact me with any questions.
