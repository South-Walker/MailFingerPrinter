Marcus --

I would recommend that Enron not do anything to modify the Clinton MBR tariff at FERC right now.  It may make sense for Sam Behrens to work up a "clean up" filing to be ready to go upon any action.

Pls give me a call if you want to discuss or would like us to take a different approach.

Jim
