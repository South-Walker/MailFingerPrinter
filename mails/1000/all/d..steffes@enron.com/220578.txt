Subject: Enron Softball Tournament


Hey Gang,
 
On November 10th Enron will be hosting its annual fall softball tournament.  The tournament will be a one day event Barker Cypress Sports Plex on I - 10 ( instructions will be provided). At least 3 games will be played, winner takes all.  It is not mandatory that you participate in all of the games, but it is important that we field at least 9-10 individuals at all times.  There is a mandatory minimum of 5 women and 5 men permitted on the field at all times. If the team does not have enough female participants every inning will start with one out.  There is a fee of $10 dollars for the tournament that will cover the cost of a tee shirt and lunch at noon.  There will be a risk assumption form to be singed and turned in by the end of the week. The forms will be available in the clerk/assistants area on the 47th floor.  
 
Please bring your baseball gloves game faces and your ability to have fun.
 
Thanks,
