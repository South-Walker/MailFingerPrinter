As we discussed  today, PJM will be disclosing the attached statement at the PJM Energy Markets  Committee meeting in Wilmington, DE this afternoon.
 
I look forward to  receiving from you a formal notification that you have become Enron's PJM  Members Committee representative and also providing me with a name and address  to forward the November 2001 PJM bill.
 
Thanks.
