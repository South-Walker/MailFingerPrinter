Please put on my calendar.  

Also, how do I find out how much vacation I have?

Thought I ought to advise you about my vacation plans for the remainder of the year:

October 5, October 8-12
December 19-21, December 26-28 and December 31(December 24-25 are Enron holidays)

I also have the floating holiday which I will take before year-end.  According to the timekeeping system, I will have 5 days carryover for 2002.
