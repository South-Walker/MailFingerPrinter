Subject:	Interconnection Conference Call on November 6th at 11:00 A.M.	(EST)

To prepare for Wednesday's meeting at FERC on interconnection, we will hold a conference call on Tuesday, November 6th at 11:00 a.m. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA conference call.  The topics for discussion on Wednesday and Thursday will be the scope of interconnection rights, the scope of studies associated with interconnections and the rights associated with those studies.  Please forward any really good language on these issues to Julie Simon at EPSA at jsimon@epsa.org.
