Subject: New CDWR Revenue Requirement


I have attached a comparison of the revised CDWR Revenue Requirement, along with a comparison with the July 22nd figures.
 
* The total DWR dollars decrease $471.5 million over 2001 and 2002, centered in the periods 3Q 2001 and onward.  The "past problem" actually increases by $1.9 billion (1Q & 2Q 2001).
* PG&E has their share increased $730.1 million over 2002 and 2002, centered in 1Q and 2Q 2001.
* Edison ends up with a significant decrease of $1.199 billion in 2001 and 2002.
 
 
Regards,
