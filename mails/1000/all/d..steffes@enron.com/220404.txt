How about I take the "delay" side for $200?

Latest information on CPUC Decision --

Commissioner Bilas filed an Alternative Draft for the CPUC that would:

*	hold DA suspension and have the CPUC conduct hearings that would work out details including impact on bonds and phasing ending of DA,
*	resolved issues related to credits and payments of Negative CTC, and
*	hold hearings dealing with bottoms-up ratemaking for DA.

This is effectively an updated version of the alternate that Bilas put out last time the CPUC considered this issue.  It is a long-shot that this alternative would be approved.  

Our current information is still that the CPUC will vote to suspend DA as of Sept 1.
