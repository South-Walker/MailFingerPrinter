Jim,

We have Rebecca Fite on our team working New Market Entry (also working with Nancy Hetrick from Legislative Affairs) as the point for EES.  Rebecca reports to Jason Woodward on my team.

There is also an EWS new market entry team that is under their (EWS) direction.  I think the two groups are getting better coordinated but I would be interested in what are the issues?  

Please let me know and we'll sort through the details.

Thanks for the heads-up,

Evan

Evan --

Who is responsible for completing all paperwork for entering a new market?  Is it someone on your team or someone from CEC?  There have been some issues with getting everything coordinated lately and I wanted to make sure that we knew who was on point.
