FYI.  You may want to discuss with Becky.

As an outgrowth of the meeting Leslie and I had with Scott and Hunter a couple of weeks ago, we have begun work to develop an electronic tool that would allow us to provide ongoing summaries of FERC gas activities, and possibly electric activities, in a format that can be linked to the Fundamentals intranet site used by the traders.  We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order, filing, etc. with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information.  This would replace the paper copies you and your people are currently getting.  Many details remain to be worked out, but we will keep you advised.  In the meantime, could you please provide a contact on your side with whom we could discuss technical issues?
