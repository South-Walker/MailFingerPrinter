The tough question may be taking a long-term cash committment and transforming it into a single NPV payment (discount rate issues), assuming that is part of the options.

Subject:	Michigan Status re QFs

Rick -- As discussed, here is a brief updated status of the Michigan regulatory status as it pertains to QFs in the state.  In the debates over PA 141 we won several key points pertaining to OFs and agreements with utilities.  As you also know, the retail market will open 1/1/02 and MPSC decisions are expected within the next two weeks or so.  I have not covered the retail market because the previous status did not focus on that market segment.  If I can be of further help, please let me know.
