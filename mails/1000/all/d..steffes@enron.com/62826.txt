The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.

There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.

Please call with any questions.

Jim,

I listened into the call for the PUC press conference and they plan to go forward with the vote tomorrow regarding direct access; however, they will not vote on the rate order until a later time due to the high volume of comments (they predict it will be voted on before Sept. 20th though.)  Let me know if you need more info about the call.  Thanks, A.
