I don't know if we need to do anything.  Seems like they are just acquiring=\
 the MAIN facilities, not market design material.  Have you spoken to anyon=\
e at ARTO to inquire?\

\
Jim and Christi,\
\
The attached document is a contract, approved by ARTO's members, covering t=\
he sale of MAIN's facilities and transfer of assets to ARTO.  The document =\
raises the question of whether the Alliance is violating FERC's July 12 ord=\
er by making "business decisions" that should be made by an independent boa=\
rd. You'll recall the language in the July 12 Order -- "We further direct t=\
hat from the date of this order an independent board be established to make=\
 all business decisions for the RTO."  The footnote following that statemen=\
t references the Grid Florida order, in which the Commission stated: Leasin=\
g office space, establishing employee benefit plans, putting accounting sys=\
tems into place and other basic intrastructure tasks....clearly do not pose=\
 independence concerns.  Regarding the acquisition of transmission faciliti=\
es...., any agreements for such acquisitions that are entered into before t=\
he independent Board is selected will be carefully scrutinized."  Thereafte=\
r the Commission identified several "more problematic' steps necessary for =\
implementing market design, including the acquisition of software and other=\
 systems implementing market design as significant to the future operatioin=\
 of the RTO, and required that any acquisition of software or other systems=\
 implementing market design not be undertaken until the independent Board h=\
as been seated and given approval.\
\
To the extent the facilities conveyed to ARTO via the Asset Purchase Agreem=\
ent impact market design, the transaction is problematic.  The purchased as=\
sets include certain software licenses, but these may not be "market design=\
"-sensitive.\
\
Please let me know if you want the Midwest team to pursue this issue.\
