There are some Commodity meetings.  One with Jim Wood and one with Greg Sharp.  Harry, can you please call and get on these meeting schedules?

Also, Guillermo Canovas and Melinda Pharms are going to the EES gas meeting weekly.

I am going to start periodically attending the SE power origination weekly meetings.  Mike attends the Midwest origination meetings and I have gotten very positive feedback from the originators.  I'll find out what the Services group and Northeast origination has in the form of regular meetings.  Are there any that we should attend for EES?  Let me know if I should ask them.
