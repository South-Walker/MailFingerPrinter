Subject:	Rulemaking on Public Utility Filing Requirements

Please see the attached summary of the notice of proposed rulemaking recently issued by FERC which proposes to revise the transactional reporting requirements for public utilities (including power marketers).  EPSA will be hosting several discussions and probably preparing comments (which are due October 5).  We need to discuss whether Enron wants to file its own comments.
