Thanks Becky.  I've truly enjoyed getting to know you better as we've worked closer these past few months.  You've taught me alot about natural gas issues and if I can ever do anything for you please let me know.

Jim

These reports detail (hopefully) all the interventions, comments, protests we have done since I started doing this.
