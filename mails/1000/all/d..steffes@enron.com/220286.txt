BRADLEY JR, ROBERT L,
 
A revised version of the Evaluation form for Associates and Analysts is attached below.  Please disregard  and destroy the form you received on July 2, as well as any blank forms retrieved from the PEP system prior to that date.  Please use the attached for Associate and Analyst  evaluations.   
 
All Evaluations for Associates and Analysts must be completed using this form.
