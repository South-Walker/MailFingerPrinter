Just to make everyone aware there is a database that is now being offered through E-Source, on a trial basis, that monitors country, regulatory, economic, environmental, legal and operational risk for about 185 different countries. The database claims that it helps its users to determine the quality of conditions and level of stability encountered by investors in each country. 
There is a specific Energy Section. That provides information and analysis on country risk, laws and regulations, industry overviews, and breaks down different parts of the countries energy sector. There is also some environmental analysis. The link to this section is:

The other section is Country Analysis and Forecast which provides information on many different types of risks and issues faced when investing in a country. The link is:
