Ed --

Can you please draft a letter (similar to what Paul Darmitzel sent to gas LDCs) to send to PECO Thursday to indicate that placing our physical load customers on bundled POLR service is not objectionable to EES?  

We have a bill due in PJM this Thursday that may not get paid.  If we don't pay PJM on Thursday, our brief analysis of the PA Supplier Tariff is that PECO can pull these customers back.  

The customers in PECO are GNO (e.g, Suiza), so not sure what the contract issues would be - maybe Michelle can help here.  My understanding is that the contracts should allow EES to serve using Utility power, so we should still have the right to determine to reject or not.

Please let me know if you can do this and if there are any issues.

Thanks,

Jim
