Great idea.  

My key points would be that (a) FERC needs to push ahead with its "right sized" RTOs and (b) focus on standardizing the tariff and market design [no more collaborative efforts].  Two simple, easy to understand thoughts.  

Also, I think that it's a mistake to use the term "large RTOs".  We don't want large RTOs.  We want RTOs that cover natural markets and benefit consumers.

In the aftermath of RTO week and following up on Rick's successful pre-briefings, we should be out spinning on the back end as well.  Perhaps Sarah, Meredith and I can come up with some thoughts on message points and send them around for comment.  Sound OK?
