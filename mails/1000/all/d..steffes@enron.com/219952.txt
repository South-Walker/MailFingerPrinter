Thanks for the invite but I'll think the DC team should brief Greg on the beltway politics and energy policy.  I'll join you guys at the Supreme Court invitation window.

Great.  Do you want to join us Wednesday morning for breakfast?  We are briefing Greg Whalley on energy issues.  Guess it is a good thing I didn't raffle off your seat at the Supreme Court, huh?

Linda & Sarah --

I intend to come to DC tomorrow night and attend the EPMI v. FERC hearing (if I still have a seat).  I'm planning on attending the GENI meeting Wed pm and Thurs.

Thanks,

Jim
