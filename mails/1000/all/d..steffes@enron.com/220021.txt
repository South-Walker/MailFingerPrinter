Thanks but my group has an all day budget meeting.  Maybe some other time.

Jim,

Judah Rose, who directs ICF's wholesale energy analysis group, is in
Houston on Monday the 15th and asked me if he should meet with you.
What do you think?

He is quite interesting to talk to if that makes any difference-- a man
of strong opinions.  His bio is in the quals package I sent you.
