Thanks.  Fully agree.  I figure Sarah's already committed to #2.

Jim -- You asked for 5 key issues:

1.  Get FERC to approve the large RTOs that include good independent RTO at top with LMP/financial rights congestion management (auction of rights, no day ahead balanced schedule requirement)
2.  Win Supreme Court case 
3.  Get good legislative language (or kill bad bills)
4. Continue opening retail opportunities for EES and EPMI
5. Good outcome in California
