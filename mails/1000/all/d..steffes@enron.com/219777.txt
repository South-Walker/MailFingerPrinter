Lamar --

It is critical that every customer in California that switched (signed new or renewal customer) during this year.  We need a contact person for each account.  The key to securing a better date is to have the customers push the Governor and the Legislature and the CPUC.

We are able to provide phone numbers and contacts through our trade groups.
