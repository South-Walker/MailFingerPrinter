It would be helpful to get a further report from Marchris.  Tauzin is likely to send an anti-RTO letter to FERC soon based on the letter from the LA PSC and from lobbying by Entergy, with whom he is very close since they are  based in New Orleans and have been his biggest and longest supporters.  Apparently, Entergy asked him for legislation to block FERC but he has said no electricity legislation will be taken up this year.  Tauzin's folks are saying a letter of some kind is a fallback that is designed to  be responsive to LA PSC and Entergy without hurting us as much as legislation.

John -- I read an Oct. 8 letter to Billy Tauzin from the LA PSC: basically against transcos, federal siting authority, enhanced ROR, roll-in of transmission costs (due to IPPs that sell power out of the state, since there is a significant amount of IPP gen going into Entergy).  Marchris met with the LA PSC, but I have not heard that they have changed their position.  Is there anything else you need us to do?
