I've always thought of each of you as the very core of the Enron I knew.  You interviewed me, you hired me, and ultimately, you made me a part of the best team of people I've ever worked with.  I've learned more in the last five years from you than I could have dreamed of.  You will be missed and thought of often.  I wish the very best for each of you and your families.  
 
Thank you for being my teachers and friends.
