Haven't got anything today.  If I get some, I'll send to EPSA.

Thanks.

Jim,
Could you please forward the e-mail that you keep receiving from Mark Bennett to admin@epsa.org.  Our IT person wants to look at it so he can stop the e-mail from being sent to you and Jose Bestard.  I am sorry for the inconvenience and hope that we can fix this problem as soon as possible.
