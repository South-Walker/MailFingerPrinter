Please take the lead working with Mike D Smith to clarify that we don't have any issues.

Thanks,

From the legal side, Ed Essandoh and Mike D Smith. 
From the business side, I think Ed Ham owns Texas products.  I would ask Jeremy and Scott who they want from the origination teams in the loop.

I have heard recently that EES is signing up customers in Texas that "passes thru" congestion.  There may be some billing and settlement issues given ERCOT's systems.  Basically, we will not know based on our bill from ERCOT what each customer's congestion was.  I want to make sure that EES billing can determine how to charge this?

Who should I talk with?

Jim
