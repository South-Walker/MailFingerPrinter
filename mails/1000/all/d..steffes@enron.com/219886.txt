Is this good or bad for Enron?  My take is that this doesn't help us push f=\
or ONE RTO.\

Attached is the much anticipated order granting clarification of the Commis=\
sion's order on the SMD filing.  The heart of this order states that when t=\
he FERC refused to act on the SMD filings, its action:\
\
was not intended to stop ISO-NE's or any other parties' efforts that might =\
further the objectives of developing and implementing a regional market in =\
the Northeast.  The Commission has already identified many aspects of such =\
a market that it expects to see:  e.g., congestion management through locat=\
ional marginal pricing, and day ahead and real time markets.  These element=\
s are likewise present in SMD.  It thus was not the intention of the Commis=\
sion that parties should stop work altogether.  Continuation of ISO-NE's ef=\
forts at developing the software and related products necessary to implemen=\
t SMD would, in fact, be a positive step toward ultimately developing a sin=\
gle Northeastern market.  We note, however, that as it continues with the d=\
evelopment of SMD, ISO-NE should be mindful of the ultimate goal of a singl=\
e Northeastern market design.  We thus urge ISO-NE to continue with develop=\
ment of SMD in every aspect, including software, in a sufficiently flexible=\
 manner so that any products developed for SMD may be readily adaptable to =\
whatever market design is ultimately proposed for the Northeastern RTO.\
