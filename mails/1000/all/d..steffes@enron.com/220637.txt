If we do take over this type of role, what issues and information would the NYISO be entitled to?  We are pushing DG and load curtailment very actively.

Yes. We informed the ISO in late September, I believe, that EES had not been involved in any of the enumerated types of activities they asked about. Paul Darmitzel was the EES lawyer who worked on the matter.
