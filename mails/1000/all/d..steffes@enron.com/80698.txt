Subject:	EPMI's FRCC membership

Dick Basford (formerly, a consultant for Enron on Florida matters) called me with a recommendation that EPMI withdraw from FRCC membership before EPMI is invoiced in February for $5750 (1/4 of annual dues of $23,000).  There is no pre-notice period for withdrawal and Dick feels that it would leave the FRCC relationship in a better light if EPMI withdraws, rather than not paying the invoice.  I tend to agree if EPMI has no further ongoing interests in trading in Florida.

UBS trading can make an application and join at any time, without an initiation fee.

Kevin/Paul--Is it ok for EPMI to withdraw?  If so, I'll draft the letter.  

Thanks.  Christi  37007
