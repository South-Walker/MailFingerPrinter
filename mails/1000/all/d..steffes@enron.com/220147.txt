Ashley -

We would prefer (given the schedules) to hold a conference call on Wednesday pm with a group of marketers/generators.  Seems like the easiest way to discuss with everyone.  It would be great to have a paper from NG earlier in the week.  

Here is our list of recommended people.  Probably best to have NG or you call to invite (rather than Enron) to highlight your interest in brokering a deal in the Midwest. 

Exelon 			(Jack Crowley)  	610 765 6612
Constellation 		(Harvey Reed)  	410 468 3480
Edison Mission Energy 	(Reem Fahey)  	312 583 6033
Reliant 			(John Orr)  	713 207 3490
Duke 				(Mike Gildea)	713 627 5529 or (Lee Barrett)  713 627 6519
Mirant 			(Jim Mayhew)  	478 579 3421
PG&E 				(Richard Doying) 	301 280-6780
Cinergy 			(Dennis Flaherty) ?????

Thanks,

Jim
