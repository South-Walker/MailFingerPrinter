I will work that out with Tom.  Do you see  the RTO matters taking up all of Tom's time? I didn't, however you may have a better handle.  The two are linked pretty closely. SM

Jim - In an effort to more efficiently participate in the DC meetings with respect to the NE RTO, I would like Tom Hoatson to lead my teams effort.  I believe he has a solid understanding of each of the ISO's/Pools, and can call upon Allegretti, Fromer and Staines as needed.  Any thoughts? SM
