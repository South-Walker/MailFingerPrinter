Not sure if we can do anything.  It's Paul's call.

FYI - 
 
Enron owns part of Northern Border Partners (as does Williams).  Crestone is a subsidiary of NBP.

Subject: Crestone (NBP) in Denver


Several weeks ago while in Denver I had the opportunity to meet with Brian Bierbach, Dan Bump and Don Baldridge at Crestone (I was with my husband who has met with these individuals before).  They told me that they are having some pretty significant government affairs issues, particularly related to the substantial discharge of water associated with coal bed methane extraction.  
 
To what extent can/should we support their efforts, if at all?  It seems to me that our closer association with them may give us more visibility and access in the Rocky Mountain region (assuming that this is desirable).  Does it make sense to explore this further?
 
I appreciate your feedback.  
 
Thanks,
 
Jennifer
