Jean --

You may want to call Jeff and find out where he is going with this talk?  We still need to meet with a detailed plan on Texas.  Maybe next week or soon thereafter.

Jeff -- Can you also keep Leslie, Becky and Jean (Austin office) in the loop on your TX intrastate issue (so we can keep our reg/advocacy issues coordinated).  Thanks.
