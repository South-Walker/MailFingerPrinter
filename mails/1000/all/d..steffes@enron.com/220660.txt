FERC will be the ultimate decider on Admin Cost Adder, not the IURC.  Not s=\
ure why this is even in the Settlement except to ensure that IURC won't int=\
ervene at FERC.\

We should not sign based on this information.\

Subject:=09IURC - MISO SETTLEMENT\
\
I reviewed the settlement document last night and quite frankly do not see =\
a whole lot of reason to sign on at this point as it is a rehash simply of =\
things MISO is already required to do.  Moreover, the settlement would not =\
limit MISO in any future amendment to the MISO agreement, leaving them free=\
 to do as they please, post settlement.  The language in parts is a little =\
troublesome, things like, MISO "has an impressive infrastructure";  that tr=\
ansmission owners and marketers "will need to learn through experience" thu=\
s providing them an out for unacceptable behavior; acknowledgements that "i=\
t is important not to delay progress indefinately in the hope of making tra=\
nsmission system operations perfect in the Midwest for Day One," which whil=\
e we may conceptually agree with, I'd never want in writing in this context=\
 because it gives them an excuse not to adopt anything we may propose in th=\
e name of expediency; etc. Etc.  The settlement also acknowledges the reaso=\
nableness of the MISO Administrative Cost Adder but allows us to challenge =\
it in a proceeding.  This shifts the burden of proof by creating a rebuttal=\
 presumption of reasonableness which will be more difficult to litigate.\
\
I have calls into a number of intervenors to get their take on this and wil=\
l keep you apprised.
