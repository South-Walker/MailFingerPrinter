Hi Jeff.
Hope all is well.  I  have a position coming up for a trader at FPL in West
Palm Beach - don't have many specifics yet, but they are dying for someone
from Enron.  Would this be of interest to you or anyone you know?  Let me
know.

Hope you have a great Thanksgiving.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,
Barbara
