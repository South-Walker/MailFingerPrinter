Howard --

I received a call from Jeff Brown who said that he had visited the NYPSC and NYISO to discuss load curtailment.  He had placed a few calls into you and hadn't heard back.

When you get back, please let me know where this stands.  No big deal, but I want to understand what is going on with the load curtailment efforts.

Jim
