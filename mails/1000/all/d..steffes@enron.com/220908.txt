Janet --

FYI.  I intend to take vacation this Friday, all of next week, and Dec 31.

Unfortunately, Harry Kingerski, Bob Frank, Jeff Dasovich,and Christi Nicolay will also be on vacation.  

If something urgent comes up, you can call me at home (281-759-8270) or on my cell (713-851-2499).

Thanks,

Jim
