Subject:	RE: EEMC Gas License in MD - Agenda for 11/21

Update on the MD EEMC license issue - 

We talked to both Accounting and Resource Planning Staff at the MD Commission and they indicate the remaining outstanding item is a request for an unlimited, unconditional, unrestricted parental guarantee.  Suppliers have been unwilling to provide such a guarantee.  The Commission has been approving these requests for licenses on a 90 day, provisional basis, pending a later determination of how or if they will modify the parental guarantee requirement. 

We will go forward with trying to get this provisional approval tomorrow and then address the guarantee requirements as they become known.

EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Jim
