EEMC has filed in MD for a gas license.  It is on the calendar for this Wednesday.  

There have been a number of letters sent dealing with "questions" on our license.  Govt Affairs is concerned that this will be voted down by the PUC given everything that is going on with the company and our incomplete record.  We would recommend that the agenda item be removed this week and we deal with the outstanding issues.

If anyone has a significant reason not to pull the item, please let me or Harry Kingerski know as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Jim
