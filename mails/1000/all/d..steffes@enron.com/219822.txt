Those of you on this e-mail list might recall that several weeks ago I was on a quest for information on retail open access ...in every state.  

I have since learned of a website that ENA Legal has had outside counsel prepare that contains an impressive amount of information on the topic.  It includes compliance requirements, summaries of the relevant law, and much more.  I have not studied the website in any detail but have been told that it has been customized for EPMI.  Am forwarding it to you in case you might find it useful in the future.
