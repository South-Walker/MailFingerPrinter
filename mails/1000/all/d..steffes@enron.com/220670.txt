Great news!  I am involved in the sale of the South American assets, so I look forward to working with you.

Our department has revised internal priorities for the short and medium term.

Selling some of our non-strategic assets is on the top of the list.

Therefore, if you are still involved on this, you can count on me - now on a " formal basis"
