Does this make sense?

RE: EPSA Draft Comments on NYISO and Con Ed Requests to
      Extend AMP and LMM
      ? Filings Due on Friday, October 19th

The New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) and Con Ed have again made requests to extend both the Automated Mitigation Procedures (AMP) and the revised localized market-power mitigation measures  (LMM) until October 31, 2002.  Once again, EPSA has drafted a protest, arguing that the use of price correction mechanisms result in unintended, yet harmful, consequences on the market such as limiting market entry, slowing the development of risk mitigation tools, and undermining demand-side response.  EPSA's also stresses that yet another extension of the provisions, intended to address flaws in the start-up of the market two years ago, is unwarranted.

Please review the draft and forward any comments or suggestions to Erin Perrigo at EPSA at 202-628-8200 or eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Thursday, October 18th so that we can make a timely filing by Friday.
