Jason --

Dinner is at 5pm at the house.  We are catering from Eatzi's.  Casual dress is preferred.

See you then.

Jim

Jim, 
Thanks for the call.  I'll plan on coming by on Sunday, 9-2-01 @ 5pm.  Is it at the house?  BBQ? dinner dress?  I always want to look in top form for my buddy's birthday.....Jason
