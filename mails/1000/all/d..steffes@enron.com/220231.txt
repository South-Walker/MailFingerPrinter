Subject:	Storage Monetization

I spoke with Mary Kay Miller when she was in town to give her an update of where we were on the storage project.  I told her we had gotten the LeBoeuf law firm and Brown, Williams involved to help.  I told her that both firms suggested that once pipelines were sufficiently interested in the storage monetization products, they should set up meetings at FERC and with their own respective pipeline customers in order to explain specific storage monetization proposals.

She was glad for the update and was comfortable with the suggested meetings as long as Enron did not attend the meetings at FERC or with the pipeline's customers.  This seems what LeBouef and Brown, Williams had in mind, since the pipelines are responsible for the regulatory needs of the storage project.  Enron is merely offering background research in order to get the pipelines interested in the storage monetization and to give the pipelines ideas on how to put the project in the best regulatory framework at FERC.

I would like to send this note to Paul Bieniawski if you agree with my comments.
