It was generated by  another party, but it does incorporate concepts that have been previously  discussed.  Rex sent the document.

Thanks again, Larry.  One more question: is  this an AEP document, or was it generated by another party?

We received a copy last  night at the same time Chris Reeder did.  No talks have been scheduled,  however, there is a prehearing conference tomorrow and there may be some  discussion afterwards.

Thanks, Larry.  What is the date of this  document?  Are there ongoing settlement talks with any party or the  staff?

Larry, is there a proposed settlement in this  case that is circulating?  I
just heard a rumor, and our clients are  clamoring to know.  If there is such
a settlement document, could you  email it to me?
