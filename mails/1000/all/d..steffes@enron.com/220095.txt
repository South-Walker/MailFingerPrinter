Thane's daughter, Sarah, is in Texas Children's Hospital.  I spoke with Thane this afternoon, Sarah will have surgery tonight.  The surgery is exploratory in nature, as well as repair of her broken leg. She has been in a great deal of pain since last night. 
 
This has been and continues to be a very difficult time for Thane and his wife, Linda. I sent a doll to Sarah, she is three years of age, from the American Girl Collection on behalf of governmental affairs.  Jean
