Christi & Jim,

	The Wyoming Energy Commission has a meeting on  Tuesday and Wednesday in Laramie.  Since they pay for travel, I am going to be leaving tomorrow and coming back on Thursday afternoon  (driving back to Denver to fly home).  If you need to reach me for anything I will have my cell phone, however, the outside connection for the computer is cut off, so I can only get e-mail when I come into the office.  I will come into the office on Friday morning.

Steve
