Susan --

Can we sit down tomorrow or Monday for 30 minutes to discuss.  Maybe at 11am Friday.  Want to get an idea of the timing and our position.

Thanks,

Jim

I am not certain that Sam Behrend's attachment went through to you all last night.  Attached is a copy of the current version of the document (it includes Sam's overview).

Thanks,
