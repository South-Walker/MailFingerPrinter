I am attaching a memo I prepared - Steffes did a bulletized version that we'll forward.  Also, I send the schedule and summary/update of current status

Subject:	Refund Proceeding Update

As I talked with Jim yesterday, Belden would like a short overview of the refund proceedings:  schedule, key issues, etc.

If you can pass on whatever you have I can prepare such a memo.  Or let me know and I can call Fergus.

Thnks.
