ISO-NE is seeking the following by December 20, 2001 to continue Enron's presence in the market --

EPMI 	
	Amount Due	$2.1 MM
	Security	$112.1 MM

EES/EEMC
	Amount Due	$6.2 MM
	Security	$22.2 MM

1.	We are verifying these figures (ISO-NE may have EES and EPMI Amount Due reversed)
2.	The process post 12/20/01 is unclear - not sure if Enron companies can schedule without posting Security
3.	Surety Bonds have been revoked and Safeco/Fireman's sent notices that Bonds can not be used for post-petition claims
	EES	#6131506	$12.0 MM
	EES	#11133420767	$8.0 MM
	EEMC	#11133420783	$14.4 MM	
	EPMI	#6131468	$12.0 MM
	EPMI	#6107679	$40.0 MM

I can't imagine that Enron will post collateral in these amounts.  In the CAISO market, Enron has 3 days of projected expenses as Security coupled with a going-forward power supply.  May be an alternative worth considering?

Any other questions, please call me at 3x7673
