Sarah --

We have the last draft.  I was talking with Rick yesterday and I don't think that we want to publish it or use it publicly.  It did it's primary job of validating that a non-gas model structure would not be harmful to Enron's interests.

Give me a call.

Do we have a revised draft of Seab's paper "Moving from RTOs to Effective Power Markets?"  It would be a timely paper to have now, and Linda has asked for an updated version, if we have one.

Thanks
