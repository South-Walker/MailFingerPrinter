I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.

Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).  I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a conference call to discuss the draft.

My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work through AReM.

Thanks,

Jim
