Subject:	Update on Timing of Proceedings

As Project Lead of one or more of the proceedings that are currently underway at FERC, would you please send to this group a timeline (date of filing or date of FERC issuance, due date for comments, estimated date for FERC action) for each of the proceedings that you are the assigned lead.  For example, for RTO Week, the timeline would be:


Project:  RTO Week

RTO Week									October 15-19

Comments on RTO Week							November 3

Estimated Date for Draft Circulation (and who is responsible for the first draft)	November 1 (Sarah will write the first draft)

Estimated Date for FERC Action							Mid-December (which could be in the form of additional proceedings, such as a NOPR)


Because we have so many proceedings pending, and because FERC continues to change the dates for interventions and comments, this information will allow us all to keep on top of what needs to be done.

Please send your responses to this group by COB Wednesday.

Thanks

Sarah
