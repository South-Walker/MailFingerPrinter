Luiz -

I would like to schedule a phone call with Nick and the PUCT staff to understand the implication of this...  Maybe he isn't asking for too much, but let's get some clarity before we say anything at FERC.

Can you please set something up with you, Christi, Jean and me for Friday pm and then we'll go outside next week??

Jim

Jim

You were right. SPP is going to use this episode as a lever to be "promoted" to an RTO. 

Texas is recommending three steps to introduce competition at Texas-SPP. One is described as follows:


*	Support the SPP's efforts to begin wholesale market operations: Mr. Brown, Vice President of SPP, testified that SPP can begin wholesale market operations and complete systems testing by April 1, 2002. He has requested that the SPP Board approve his recommendation to start to wholesale market operations. This Commission should support that process by:

-	Requesting in writing that the SPP Board begin wholesale operations as soon as possible with a target date of completing systems testing by April 1, 2002.
-	Advising FERC of the need to support SPP wholesale market operations. While Mr. Brown testified that the recent July and September Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) orders regarding SPP's start up expenditures will not impede SPP from implementing wholesale market operations, this Commission should advise FERC that the findings from our hearing show the need for FERC to fully support SPP wholesale operations startup.
