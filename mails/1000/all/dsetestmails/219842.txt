I heard a rumor that Laura Luce was moving back to Houston for another job and would be replaced, but there has been no official confirmation so I'm assuming no changes yet.

BTW, I will be out of the office Monday-Thursday of next week.  I'll have a computer (if it works) and will call in for messages so if you need me, please leave me a message.  Thanks.

Can you give me a list of the gas contacts (desk heads) for trading and origination?  Thanks.
