Wanda --

Who do I need to call at EPMI West Power to discuss the following -

We are considering proposing a Settlement for SCE.  The language we are considering on the Negative CTC is as follows.  Does this help or hurt?  Do we have "final ISO invoices"?  

Please call me.

Jim

"Calculation of those energy credits utilizing the PX Rate Schedule shall include a "pro-ration of bill cycles through and including January 18, 2001, and true-ups for ISO settlement charge forecasts based on the December 2000 and January 2001 final ISO invoices."
