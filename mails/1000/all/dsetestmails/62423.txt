Louise- 

Please see the attached below.  It appears that the earliest we can visit with FERC is next Thursday and Friday (as opposed to Monday and Tuesday).  The FERC has a Public Meeting (held every two weeks) next Wednesday and everyone runs around the building trying to get the Orders finished.

Also attached is a list of issues that Netco will need to develop with the winning bidder to put in our FERC filing for Market-Based Rate schedule.

Thanks,

Jim

Jim:

Sam spoke with Cindy Marlet and they are aiming for Thursday, January 17.  She said there was no way they could meet with Netco before the Commission meeting.  Cindy is checking with Dan Larcamp and Mike Coleman to see if they are available (these are the two people she thinks we need to meet with).  Cindy also wants the meetings with the Commissioner Assistants to occur after the meeting with staff, so Cindy will have to set up the meeting before we schedule with the assistants.  We're waiting to hear back from Cindy now.

I'll keep you posted.

By the way, I loved the marker picture and have sent it on to lots of other people.

Any luck on setting up meetings with FERC?
