Jeff --

Please send the invoice to my assistant - Linda Noske - to have her take it through the system.  Her phone number is 713-853-6082.

Thanks,

Jim

Jim,

In trying to clear up some of our outstanding invoices, I contacted the
Enron Accounts Payable Department and they have no record of our May invoice
for $12,500.

They told me to go ahead and send a copy of the invoice directly to them,
but it will expedite things if I include on the invoice your Enron company
name and number and your external identification number. If you could reply
to this message with that info, I'd appreciate it.

If I can answer any questions regarding the invoice, or anything else for
that matter, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks.

Regards,
Jeff
