I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried 
the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures 
off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as 
the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.

All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.
