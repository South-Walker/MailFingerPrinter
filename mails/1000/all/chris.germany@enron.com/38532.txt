We are parking gas in Egan on the 30th (deal 508572) and taking it out 
rateably in January (deal 508582).  ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume 
parked.

These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals.

Currently, I show we are parking a total of 145,052 (to be taken out in 
December) and a whopping 48,025 (to be taken out in January).

Lia, please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you 
have questions.

Thanks
