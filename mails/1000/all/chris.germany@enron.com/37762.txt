I'm not aware of an AP rate schedule.  AS (tariff sheet #205) and IPP (tariff sheet #215) are separate rate schedules in the tariff.  AS pools are used to aggregate production meters on CGAS's system and are assigned a specific geographical location on the pipeline.  AS pool meters can be used as primary receipt points on firm transportation agreements whereas IPP Pool meters are not.

Shemin, can you answer Ed Smith's question concerning the pooling tarriff?

Ed McMichael, do you have knowledge concerning the EES pooling agreements?

Two quick questions:

1.   The Columbia Gas motion refers to two pooling agreements, the IPP
Service Agreement and the AS Service     Agreement.  Ms. Shemin's e mail
attaches a copy of a rate schedule entitled "IPP Rate Schedule
Interruptible  Paper Pools."   Does this rate schedule also apply to the AP
Service Agreement, or is there another rate        schedule for that
agreement?.

2.   Can Mr. McMichael swear the affidavit with respect to the pooling
agreements, which are with EES, not ENA?
