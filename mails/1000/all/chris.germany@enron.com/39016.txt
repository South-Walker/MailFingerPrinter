Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please 
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The 
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating 
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June 1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.
