Hey buddy.  I'm looking for a Boston Gas contract and I thought you might have a copy of it.  Its the involving 35,000 dth of transport on Iroq and Tenn.  Don't look to hard for it but if you do have it, just let me know and I'll come make a copy.

Thanks

I've already gone through Maureen's desk and she didn't have a copy.
