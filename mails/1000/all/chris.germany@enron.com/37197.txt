Reliant Energy.  I would like to talk to Reliat if you want to do something with them.  I currently have a cash balance of $228,000 with Reliant.  We are going to send them and invoice for $156,000 for sales ENA made to Reliant.  That will leave me with about $71,000 and maybe we can do something to work it off.


Cinergy will not trade with Enron.  Robin Barbe's contact told her they would not trade with us regardless.
