Hey, I'm older than you, therefore my life expectancy is less.  So I have much less time to spend QUALITY time with Little Wilbur.  I propose that I stay home and be a house husband.  You would have a hot (oatmeal) meal waiting for you when you get home.  The dog would love you, the cat would love you, I would love you.......

What do you think?
