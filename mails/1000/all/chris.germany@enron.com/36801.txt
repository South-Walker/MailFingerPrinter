Could one of you tell me how much gas we delivered to American Public Energy Agency in Dec 2001?  in 2002 if any?

I don't have a good way to search for deals but I did find 2 deals on Northern Natural Gas at the Demarc point.  All of the information is below.  It appears that both deals were pathed on contract 105515.
