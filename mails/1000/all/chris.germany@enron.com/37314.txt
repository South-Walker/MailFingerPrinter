Melissa verified receipt of our $45,000.00 wire yesterday.  Thanks Melissa.

You should receive the following wires today.
$683,835.20 for baseload gas on Trunkline (6,800 dth x 31 days x $3.244)
$1,365,767.00 for baseload gas on Florida (13,000 dth x 31 days x $3.389)

Our current swing gas cash balance is $81,700.00 so we may not send another wire until next week.

Also, Robin Barbe will be my backup when I'm out.  Her number is 713-853-7177.

Thanks
