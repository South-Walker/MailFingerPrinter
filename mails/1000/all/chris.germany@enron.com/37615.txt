It's the first day of school in Houston and the teacher thought she'd
get  to know the kids by asking them their name and what their father does
for a  living.

The first little girl says: "My name is Mary and my daddy is a postman."

The next little boy says: "I'm Andy and my Dad is a mechanic."

Then one little boy says: "My name is Jimmy and my father is a striptease
dancer in a cabaret for gay men."

The teacher gasps and quickly changes the subject, but later in the
school yard the teacher approaches Jimmy privately and asks if it was really
true that his Dad dances nude in a gay bar  He blushed and said,
"I'm sorry but my dad is an 
 
	1) auditor for Arthur Andersen

	OR

	2) a trader for Enron


 and I was just too embarrassed to say so."
