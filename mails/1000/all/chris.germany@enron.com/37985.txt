We have two firm transportation agreements on Tennessee Pipeline.  The long term Boston Gas capacity release and a short term contract which expires on 1/31/2002.  The monthly demand charge on the short term capacity is $15,200.00.

Do we need to reject the short term capacity before it expires?  To my knowledge, we did not flow any gas on this contract for December or January.
