Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward 
deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.

Example:  See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.  I was concerned that we would 
double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show 
reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on 
the Physical Forward sale as well.
