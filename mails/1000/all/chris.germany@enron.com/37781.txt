Ain't that the truth.  Wait just a minute, I took Monday off and I think I'm taking Friday of next week off.  Never mind.

Five day work weeks are VERY long.  I haven't had one in a few weeks.

QUOTE OF THE DAY
=========================
"Do we really want to bid for the games in the future? It's a
valid question. I believe the money is well spent; it makes
a great statement for peace. But is it a good investment?"
-MITT ROMNEY, president of the Salt Lake City Olympic organizing
committee, on the cost of holding the Games in the United
States.

Good Question?
