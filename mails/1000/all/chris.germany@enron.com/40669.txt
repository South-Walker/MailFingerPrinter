It's missing the demand charge.  I'll get you to rerun it for me in the 
morning and see if the demand charge shows up.

Please send me the Ogy invoice for March.  I did such a good job of doing my 
job that I think everything in the system is ok.  By the way - I'm on 
vacation for a week or so startig Friday.  I should have New Power updated by 
tomorrow.
