#67401 and #70457 are the correct contracts.  #67401 was intended to come out in Dec and #70457 was intended to come out in Jan.

Hey there...

Can you please verify the following. Our files indicate that the two pal contracts for TCO are 39607 and 38079.
TCO is invoicing us on contracts 67401 and 70457. All these contracts show 310,000 MDQ.

Which ones are correct and current. I am assuming only 2 are or should be current. Please advise.

Thanks,
Maria
