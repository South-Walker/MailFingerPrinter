I took off all last week.  Chad was married last Saturday, and I spent the 
rest of the week at Dad's and the hospital.

I talked to Jerry today - He has been up there since last Wednesday.  The Dr. 
said Pops has anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month.  They are taking him out of 
the hospital tomorrow or Wed.  I'll be going up there quite a bit for a while.

There is nothing wrong with a good heart attack.
