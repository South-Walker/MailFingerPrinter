Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non 
bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, 
receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is 
$2.40 = $.08.

Everything looks good except the recallable factor.



Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446.  
I can't get my machine to print out the forms.

Good Luck.
