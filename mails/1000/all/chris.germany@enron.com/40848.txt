Scott Goodell said the Sonat items look correct.  The other items are for the 
Central Desk and I don't know who looks at it.  It's probably ok since the 
Central Desk items are more straight forward.

Please take a look at these prior period adjustments that came across in 
Unify this month.  Should I forward these invoices to New Power?


Thanks!
