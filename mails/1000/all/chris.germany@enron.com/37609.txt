Okay, Chris - - - - to confirm or not to confirm????

Stacy, does anyone in legal want to be included on this in the future (especially since you are Scotland bound)? Or should we just coordinate this with Chris?

Thank you!
Cyndie

Ann, 
Please coordinate with Chris Germany on these.  He is very involved in these deals and should be consulted about the paperwork.

Thanks, 

Stacy
