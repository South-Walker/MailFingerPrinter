I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.  

Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.  As far as I can tell, 
ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.  So, we should show a 
purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more 
complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues.
