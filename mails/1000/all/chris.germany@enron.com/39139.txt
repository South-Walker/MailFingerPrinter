Subject: Deals outside Agreement


Chris;

Can you send me confirmation on the deals that were done for COH outside the
Enron-CES agreement.
The IF Index for TCO App pool is 4.53 +.0175+.02+transport.  Can you confirm
each market area delivery point with volume and delivered price.
I need a confirmation record for our files since we are buying this gas
on-behalf of someone else.

thanks - Charlie
