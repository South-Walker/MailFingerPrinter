FREEDOM!!!!!!!!!!   What am I going to do with my time???????   Fishing, sitting around in my underwear, spending money without repercussion, going to the BUFFFFEEEET at Ryans.  Heck, I might even make a special trip to Conroe to the best Ryan's in the WORLD>

Good morning, 
TGIF 
Put this on your calendar: I'm taking vacation Nov 16 thru Nov 26.  I'll be in OR the 17th thru the 24th.  I still wish you would come up there with me, at least part of the time.
