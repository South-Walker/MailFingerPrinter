Cash till Williams does a little better.   I'm swinging back to pizza now.

Chrissy,

Always in the past I've had my stock dividends re-invested as stock.  We can
make an election every year as to whether we get our dividends in stock,
cash, or 50/50.  I wonder if this year I should get the cash or if I should
just keep doing stock.  Any thoughts?
