Vickie gave me an open season notice on Transco's Momentum Expansion 
Project.  Bids are due Thursday, Sep 29th.  Momentum is expected to be in 
service by 5/1/2003.

Shippers can elect the following receipt points, St 65, St 85, or Destin.  
The primary delivery point is St 165.  The minimum term is 15 years.  I will 
still be here doing transport.
