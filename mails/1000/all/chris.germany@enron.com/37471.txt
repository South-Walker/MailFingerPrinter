Our current cash balance with Reliant is $52,850.00.  We did not request any gas for tomorrow under the swing arrangements.  I have requested a wire in the amount of $22,000.00 to be made on Friday April 12th.

Melissa, I had to move the payment to Friday because some Enron "approval" people are out of the office but we have a large cash balance and it shouldn't be a problem if it gets delayed untill Monday.

Also, Tiffanie Wheeler discovered an error in my worksheet that impacted the cash balance effective March 1st forward.  My worksheet is set up so that any change in a volume or price for a prior month will change the current cash balance.  I will keep track of all changes at the bottom of the Summary worksheet in this file.
