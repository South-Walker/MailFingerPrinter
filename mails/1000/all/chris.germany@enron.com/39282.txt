This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the 
Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part.

Thanks Brenda.

We reimburse 89.27% of the total Tennessee and Iroquois charges unless 
Houston diverts to a more expensive place.  In that case we only reimburse 
per the maximum to Boston.

The transportation invoice from Tennessee Gas Pipeline for service contract 
number 29667 for February 2000 production included
$379,400 in Demand Charges and $5,998.36 in Commodity Charges.  Please let me 
know what portion and percentage of charges are reimbursed by Enron Canada.

Thanks,
