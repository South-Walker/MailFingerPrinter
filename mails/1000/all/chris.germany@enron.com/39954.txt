Subject: FINAL - January 2000 AGT volumes

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    This is the
breakdown for 1/1.   For Boston Gas and S. Ct.  we are told what to deliver 
and
we will know that on Thursday.   The number on the attached spreadsheet is our
estimate of what Boston Gas and S.Ct. should be.    We will fine tune those 
two
ldc's on Thursday.    For the month of January we will need a range from 3200
dth to 4300 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of
markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.
