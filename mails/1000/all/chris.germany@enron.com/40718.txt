I thought class was on Saturday and as for the child - use duct tape.  It has 
great sticking power!!

Chris,

I could probably do a quick dinner downtown.  With a small child and graduate 
school I have trouble squeezing normal duties into a day, but would like to 
try to squeeze in a dinner...if nothing less maybe just an appetizer.
