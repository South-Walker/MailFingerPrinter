Subject: Sale Of Columbia Energy Services' Mass Markets


Hope you have seen the press release from Friday. If not, please see the
attached, announcing the agreement to sell the residential and small 
commercial
operations to The New Power Company. Please be aware that the deal is not
closed yet and no customers will be transferred to TNPC until all federal,
state and utility program requirements have been completed by both CES and
TNPC. We are attempting to keep you informed of any updates and I remain the
main gas utility contact for CES, so if you have any questions, please contact
me at 703/561-6447.

Thanks,
Jeffrey P. Porter
