Chris - 
I've expired access to the four persons you requested be terminated.? 
Additionally, I need to update our Security Administrator records by 
replacing Dan Junek with someone else.... perhaps yourself.? At any rate, I 
need a name, business address, phone and fax number for the designated 
Security Administrator.? If questions, please advise.? Thanks, 
Chris.????????????????? /Bob
