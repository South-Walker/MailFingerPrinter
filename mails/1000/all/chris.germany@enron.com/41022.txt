Subject: VNG Demand charge for November, 2000


I need the demand charge entered for VNG for November 2000 production.  The 
total charge is $2482811.34.  Attached is a copy of the invoice.  This has 
been paid and I need the charges in as soon as possible in order to apply the 
money.  Thanks for your assistance.
