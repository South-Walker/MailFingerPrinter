I believe the EOG volumes listed below are ANR citygate deliveries.  

Hunter, Dan and I will be entering all the physical retail volumes in Sitara 
for the East Desk.  Let me know who you want us to give this information to 
on the Central Desk.

Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle
Glass will swing)

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.


Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.
