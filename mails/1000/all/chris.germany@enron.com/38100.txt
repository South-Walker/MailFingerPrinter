We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.
