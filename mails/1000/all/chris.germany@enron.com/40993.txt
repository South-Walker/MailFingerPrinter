Attached is my pricing and the capacity for December.   I went thru the 
capacity fairly close on CGAS so this should be correct.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

Also, for the 1st,  I'm showing a FOM volume of 31,679 dth per day.  This is 
a combination of your max FOM Exhibit 1 gas, plus the CGLF volume plus some 
NX1 CGAS volumes.
