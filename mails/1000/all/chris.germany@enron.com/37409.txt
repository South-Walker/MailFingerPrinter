For May 2002, Ponderosa Pines is electing to take 20,000 per day.  Please confirm receipt of this email.  We are moving today so I will be out of the office for the rest of the day.  FYI, Sabra Dinari is the scheduler and Kathy Kelly is my backup.  Sabra's number is 713-853-9781 and Kathy's number is 713-853-5858.

Thanks
