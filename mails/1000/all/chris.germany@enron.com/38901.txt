Hi Team.  I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.  Effective 
September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.  All 
existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara. 

If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the 
counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to 
"The New Power Company".  

Thanks
