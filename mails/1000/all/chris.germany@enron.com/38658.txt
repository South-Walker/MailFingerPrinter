I need to check this one.  We have several contracts with evergreen clauses.  
I didn't think this one had an evergreen clause but maybe it did.

Deal # 118000 - Your comments on the terms tabs was this was 1 year deal 
which would end 9/30/2000.
I noticed that Jesse extended the date range to 2001.  Is this correct?
