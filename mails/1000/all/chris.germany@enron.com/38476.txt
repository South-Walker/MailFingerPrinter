Hi Scott,

India is great!  We have setteled so well here.  The staff at Baroda office 
are very friendly,  I just love it here, it is so peaceful.  Children love 
the open space, all the rides on camel,scutoor, rikshas.  

I have found couple of spots here for you and Chris, just hop on the plane, 
you will not regrate it.  

Have a wonderful weekend.  Can't wait to see the capacity trading page.  

Bhavna
