Due to credit concerns, Carol and Bjorn would like to know all counter parties that we are currently buying or selling spot gas with.

Ex:  I've been buying gas from Reliant Energy Services, Inc. each month to serve one of my term markets.  According to Bjorn, the Credit Committee will no longer approve of my prepayments to Reliant for base load supply.
