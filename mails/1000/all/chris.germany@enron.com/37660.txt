I've never talked to Ed about any of this.  I just sent him this email the day you and I spoke.  You might forward this on to him with your comments.

Robin is at home.  She tried to call you this morning and I suggested that I just send you an email of some of the items she wanted to discuss and you could call her when you have time.

Melissa, Daniel, didn't know if you had her number on file.  Her number is 713-721-0709.
