Oh now you're teasing me!  I went riding last night.  I think I need some 
winter motorcycle gear.  My brother and I are taking a biking trip in 
November - don't know where we are going yet.  

How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now?

Long time no talk.  How have you been?  Have you been riding your motorcycle 
a lot?  Maybe we can go to Barnaby's next week.
