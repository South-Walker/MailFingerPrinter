We are at a $5.44 in storage on CGAS.  I don't think I can give you anything 
on CNG but I'm still checking.  Just assume I can't and I call you if I find 
something.

The screen went up $.20 today.

Looking to buy gas in storage for a transfer for BGE in Sep. I need 6,000 for
TCO and 1,500 for CNG/Dom. Can you sell?
