Silly me.  I goofed, I had the wrong beginning balance in my worksheet.  Currently looking at sending out $30,000 on Thursday.

Subject:	 Prepay to Reliant for 3/121/02

I'm estimating a $50,000 prepay to Reliant this Thursday.  Cash is up $.20 from Friday.  I may need to make the prepay on Wed again.  I'll have a better idea after 9:00 AM tomorrow.
