Enbridge is going to send me an invoice tonight or tomorrow.  They have been sending us and invoice each month.  I'll get back to you.  I just know we owe money on this and I hope its not more than what we are making on the deal.

Hey, I don't think you should show any cash flow for the Enbridge storage until I talk to them this afternoon.  I'm writing an email to you and a few others about what I think we should forcast and I want to talk to them first.  But between you and me, I'm thinking we show about $600,000 or so.
