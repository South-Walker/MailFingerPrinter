You are my hero buddy. 

And you think I should get married?   FYI  while everyone else has been stressed out about work, I've been focused (VERY STRESSED OUT) with more personal issues.  Every time I ask for some kind of sign, someone comes along and tells me I should get married.

Hmmmm.


Take care and best of luck to you and the family.
