Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as 
of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to 
CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and 
monthly activity.

If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the 
beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To 
correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on 
April 30th was 13%.

Let me know if you have questions.
