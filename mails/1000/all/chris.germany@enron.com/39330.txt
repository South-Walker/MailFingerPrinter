Hey gang.  Joanie is still working on current day activity.  

Joanie, please call Jeff Porter at 703-561-6447. 

I will try to update this worksheet every other day if not every day.

Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a 
total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice 
numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes 
are on "Sheet 1".
