I am changing the following deal tickets in Sitara for March 2002.  I'm still not sure what to do about all the volumes showing up in Sitara for non-active deals.


Counterparty		Sitara		Pipeline		Comment
Midland Cogen		332163		PEPL		Changed volume from 0 to 5,000 per day
Midland Cogen		340362		TRKL		Changed volume form 0 to 6,800 per day
