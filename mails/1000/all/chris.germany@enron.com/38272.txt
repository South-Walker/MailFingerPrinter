This is the demand charge for The New Power Market area demand charges.  It's under the "New Retail Mrkt" tab on 2001new03.xls.  They owe us the dough.

Chris,

The New Power Company deal #649352 has a demand charge (income) of $1,183,732 that you added.  Do they owe us this money and how is it related to this deal.
I looked in your demand charge spreadsheet to see if we reflected it in our P&L through a reimbursement but am unable to find it.

Your help and input would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks

Kam
