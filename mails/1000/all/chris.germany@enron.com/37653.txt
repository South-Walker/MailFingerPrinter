Hey team.  ENA should be wiring Reliant $25,000.00 today.

I will be out tomorrow and Christina Sanchez (713-345-7791) will be backing me up.

Christina, tomorrow morning, call Jim Taylor (713-207-1482) by 9:00 AM and let him know if we are taking the gas or not.  If Jim isn't there, ask for the person trading Florida.  Malory (don't know her last name or her number) has been backing Jim up this week.  Reliant has the option of giving us the gas in Z2 or Z3 at a Z2 GD price.  Jim will also let us take different volumes on different days over the weekend, even though it hasn't happened before.

Have a good weekend!
