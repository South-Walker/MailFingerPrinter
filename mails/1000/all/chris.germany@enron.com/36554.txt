I included this on my worksheet.

Here are some numbers you may need to reach me this weekend.

Pager  800-978-1788  does not work at my Dad's house.  And, you can leave me 
a voice message on my pager.
Home Phone 713-426-1460
Dad's number 409-858-3818

I won't be going to my Dad's until Sunday morning, returning on Monday.

Jan2000.xls

Thanks

Subject: CES Scheduling Fee

Per Colleen - ENA will bill CES $20,000.00 per month, Jan - May, and 
$10,000.00 per month June - March 2001 as a scheduling fee.

Mark, I don't think I'm going to show this money on any of my worksheets.  Do 
we need to let anyone else know?
