Rita,

I am mailing you the original Columbia Gas invoices for Feb and Mar and a copy of what I have for December.  I don't have the January invoices and I have requested a copy from Jeanne Adkins assistant at Columbia Gas.  I will also ask to have these sent to your attention in the future.

I gave Maria a copy of everything I'm mailing to you.


Thanks
