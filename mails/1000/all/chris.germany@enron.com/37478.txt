I'm not aware of anything like that.  I'll ask around.

	Chris,

	I was working on a storage deal for a Lone Star pipeline when things blew up. I know that there was a 
	rather large imbalance to the tune of about 800,000 dth in EES's name. I was just following up to see
	if any actions had been taken to utilize or liquidate this asset.
