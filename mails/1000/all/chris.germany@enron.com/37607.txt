Thanks to each of you who agreed to sponsor my MS150 bike ride.  Can you please complete the following spreadsheet and return it to me?

 << File: MS150 Pledge Sheet.xls >> 

Just a few things you should be aware of:

1.  I prefer checks written to "National MS Society"  

2.  Please send checks to me (via post or interoffice mail) at: 
     work - 1400 Smith Street, ECS 04443, Houston, TX, 77002 or
     home - 3400 Timmons Lane #66, Houston, TX, 77027
     Or call me at 35966 and we can arrange something.

3.  The purpose of completing the pledge sheet is so that MS can send each of you a receipt for your records.

My riding continues....the wet roads made for an interesting ride on Sunday!!  Again, I thank each of you for your contribution.
