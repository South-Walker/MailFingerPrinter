Update

Jerry and I went to East Texas this weekend.  we withdrew $750.00 from the 
Fredonia bank and I'm going to deposit that in the Credit Union.  I also took 
the petty funds in the kitchen drawer - $72.00.

AND we did get $2,000.00 deposited into Dad's account from the Credit Union.

later dudes
