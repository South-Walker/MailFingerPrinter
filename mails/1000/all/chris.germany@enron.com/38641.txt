The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking 
of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now 
New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power 
for the gas taken out of storage.

In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e 
effective 11/1/2000.

Take a look - let me know if you have any comments.
