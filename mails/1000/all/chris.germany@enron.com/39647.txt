Hey Team!  Ms.  "Terry" Franklin is part of the team now.  Make sure you copy 
her on any appalachian/local production issues.  She will be the one setting 
this up in Sitara in the future.

Thanks.

I called Jill Linkenauger Friday afternoon... haven't heard back. My plan is 
to talk to her and then Kevin McCracken at CNR to have this agency switch 
over by April 1st. I thought it was done... but not 100% sure.

Subject: CNR Contracts.

Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR 
contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in 
the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. 
I have 50 to 70 to set up. Please let me know what you know. - Thanks, Rob
