We've chatted before but you may not remember me.  I'm currently working for the ENA Estate team and I need to purchase some Trunkline Ela gas for April.  Ruth Concannon suggested that I contact you but she didn't have your number handy.  I also have other buy/sells that come up from time to time as well.  Please let me know if you would be interested in selling us gas. 

Thanks
