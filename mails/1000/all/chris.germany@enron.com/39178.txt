Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right?

Hey Chris,

The numbers I have in the P&L for the SE  net  are  (297,048)

The numbers in your worksheet net are  (281,238) 

That isn't too big of a difference, plus it is in our favor.   A mere 
$15,810.  Should I go ahead and let that into the P&L for tonight?


Thanks!
