Steve Menke said you would know the answer.

I purchased capacity from Steve last October.  The terms were as follows;
Release Date	11/1/2001 through 3/31/2002
Volume		18,000 dth
Contract	T0181230000
Offer		#200110000095

Steve said he thought they recalled this capacity.  Would you see if it was recalled and if it was, what was the effective date of the recall.

Thanks
