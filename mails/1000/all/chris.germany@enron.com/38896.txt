Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?
