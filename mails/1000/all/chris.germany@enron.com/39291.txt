UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks 
like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify 
this information and let us know.

Subject: Capacity for UGI


Got an fax from UGI saying that the capacity they release for our customers
will be on Gulf/Tco from May thru Sep. I believe this is a change from TETCO.
Call me if you need a copy of the fax.
