I still don't have access to West (deal 1198936).  I'm almost positive I entered this deal and I thought I entered it as a Central Desk deal.  When I book my deals on Trunkline for April, should I use Central?  We will be serving the Midland Cogeneration deal #340362 for April.

I also didn't request access for ENA Upstream but Kathy Kelly should be able to take care of that.

Do you have all access that you need now?  Let me know.
