Subject: market exits


Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa
