I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index 
pricing.

Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate 
sale to you, also at the FOM price.

Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and 
enter the deals.

Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power 
for the 10th-30th at $5.68.  I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to 
incorporate it into my citygate pricing.

J-We bought 15,000/d from a 3rd party for 11/10 through 11/14. Please pull 
from our TCO Pool #69593. Our daily forcasted noms will reflect this.
C- Should we do this at GD 10-14 rather than IF FOM?
