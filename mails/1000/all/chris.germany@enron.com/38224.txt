Good morning-

Can we get together tomorrow afternoon to go through recent developments in the Tetco and Sonat 637 cases, and the Transco rate case?  Other than Bob's staff meeting from 2-3, I'm clear all afternoon so please let me know if you're free.

Is there anyone else over there I should invite?

Thanks
Suzanne
