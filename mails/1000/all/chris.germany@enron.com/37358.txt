Yesterday David Drapper (sits a few rows over from us and works for EES) asked me what the status was with the Dominion producers.  I told him we were still waiting for Dominion to call us back.  He said that Sean Holmes told them to "just pay the producers".  I told David that I wouldn't do anything without knowing what Ruth and legal are doing.

Sounds like a little tendency to "split up".  Just like the old days.
