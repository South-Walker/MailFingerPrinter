Your camera takes good photo's.

We are going to the timeshare at Canyon Lake.  Remember, they had the pig and 
it sleep with Chad and Chance.  We are trailering the motorcycles up there 
and we are going to take day trips around that area from the time share.  We 
have the timeshare Mon-Thur or Fri.  Then we are going to Dad's for a night 
or two.
