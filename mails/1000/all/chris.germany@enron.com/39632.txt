Subject: CNG-Kriscott

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

Thanks,
HG
