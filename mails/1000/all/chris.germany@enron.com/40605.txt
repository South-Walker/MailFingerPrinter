DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably 
not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to 
charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after 
providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by 
nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.
