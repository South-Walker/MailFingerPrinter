Hey-

Are you available to go to a meeeting with me at Transco on Thursday at 
12:30?  It's a special meeting,separate from the OneLine/637 meetings, that 
was set up to discuss the operational control notices, and associated 
penalties, they've proposed and issues relating to pooling.  I made the 
request to be able to rank w/in a business party from a pool on the disag nom 
which they seem to think they'll be able to accomplish.  

I'll send out a summary of the Tetco and Transco meetings this afternoon.

Please let me know if you can attend or if you think it'd be better for 
Victor (or whoever) to go.

Thanks!
Suzanne
