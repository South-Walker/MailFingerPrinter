Attached are my notes (so far) on Dominion.  This file is saved under o:/Gas Structuring/Bankruptcy Folder/Transportation/Dominion/Notes_Dominion.doc.

I also saved Dominion's motion and the attached ehibits to the motion under this directory somewhere.  I'm currently working on the excel worksheets showing all the dollars that are owed pre-petition and post-petition.

Shemin, this is NIMO's web site ==>   http://www.niagaramohawk.com/youracct/priceenrg/buspricing/buspricing.html
I think this link will take you directly to the tariff.
