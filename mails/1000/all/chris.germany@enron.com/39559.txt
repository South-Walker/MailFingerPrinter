My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.  What's bad is CES 
has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill 
them a lot more for it.  That does not mean they agree to the pricing.

Chris,

Find that local production list when you have a chance and forward it to me.

Thanks.
