Doug, I'm killing both of these deals.  The BG&E has been changing all month 
on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made 
yesterday it sounds like.

Subject: CES Intra day sales

I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 
250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is 
$3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 
51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.

Thanks
