Scott Goodell is the expert on this pipeline and I just can't say enough good 
things about him.

Victor,

I need to know who is the scheduler for this  pipeline.  Contract No. 
96031682 has an agency relationship and the agency agreement contract no. is 
96031689.  

I would like to know if we are still scheduling gas on this contract?  

Chris,

Do you know who has an executed agency agreement for  Contract No. 96031682 
between ENA and Commonwealth Energy, Inc.?


All, please respond as soon as possible.
