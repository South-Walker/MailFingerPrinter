These days, its easier for our legal department to draft or approve a new GISB than to find any of the existing documents.  The attached document is for Enron North America Corp.  David is going to see if they can use it.

If your legal department approves, please print 2 originals, fill in the Sempra information, sign it, and send it to me.

Thanks
