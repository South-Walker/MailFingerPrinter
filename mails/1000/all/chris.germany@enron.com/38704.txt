Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are 
the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000

Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?
