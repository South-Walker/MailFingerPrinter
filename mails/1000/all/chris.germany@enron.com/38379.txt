We are buying the following Tenn transport from the pipeline for the winter.  I just did the deals so I don't have the contract numbers.


Term		Demand	Comm	MDQ
Nov		.18		.02	3893
Nov-Jan		.20		.02	2500
Feb-Mar	.20		.02	2500

The Primary delivery point is CGAS - Broad Run.  The primary receipt point is meter #010698 in 500L.  We will be able to use any zone 1 receipt point but we only be able to use Broad Run as our delivery point.
