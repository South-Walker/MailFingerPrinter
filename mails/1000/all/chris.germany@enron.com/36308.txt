We did release it for March, but there is a revenue sharing mechanism in place because TW released the space for us.

The normal demand charge on the contract is $.06 per day.  For March, TW released the space at $.102 and TW gets 50% of the revenue from the release which is calculated as   (.102 - .06) x 50% = $.021.  

ENA's effective demand charge for March is (.102 - .06) x 50% +.06 = $.081 which is the rate we put in sitara #1199508.  We were not sure how TW would show this on the bill for March.

I also changed the demand charge calculation on deal 1190537 (this ticket records the demand charge as and ENA expense).  It was taking the demand rate of $.06 times 700,000 dth per month.  I changed the volume to 25,000 dth per day.

Questions?
