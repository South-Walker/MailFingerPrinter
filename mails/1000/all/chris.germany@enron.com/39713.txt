I knew we would have to address this eventually.

CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for 
tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into 
CGAS at Lebanon.

This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was 
thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it 
will be really messy in the summer.
