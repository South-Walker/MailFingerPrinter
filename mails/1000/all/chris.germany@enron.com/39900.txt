I need a new pipeline set up.  CES currently has 1.5 BCF of LNG storage on 
this pipeline under 3 separate contracts.  All 3 contracts expire 2/29/00.

Name:   Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership
Internet Address: http://www.latec.com/covepointlng/
Curve:   Tetco M3


This deal is currently entered in Sitara under deal 142034 as CPR Storage on 
CGAS.  We have withdrawals of 75,000 day from the 12th through the 31st.


Linda, would you see if you have a copy of the contracts from CES?

Please let me know what I need to do.
