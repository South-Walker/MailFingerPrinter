Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I 
remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path 
those deals and email Mark when you are done.

Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify 
after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed 
interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000.
