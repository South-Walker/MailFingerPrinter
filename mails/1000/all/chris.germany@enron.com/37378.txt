ACA			$.0021
GRI			$.0000	Note: GRI does not apply on this path because Iroq delivers gas to Tenn at wright (non GRI point)

Fuel			.5%   Note:  The Iroq Tariff allows them to charge up to 1% fuel, but I believe the max is 1% for Zone 1 to Zone 2 and .5% for Zone 1 to Zone 1 but I didn't read that in the tariff.  I think Iroq might have told me that back in normal times.
