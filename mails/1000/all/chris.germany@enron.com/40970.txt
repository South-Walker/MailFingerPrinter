I am showing a balance of 80,265 in the Egan park deal as of Jan 1, 2001.  
Egan is showing a balance of 84,944.  I am using our balance for now.  I'm 
taking 2592 dt's in to Texas Gas for the 1st and 2nd, and 2599 dt's per day 
for the balance of the month.

I tried to update all the deal tickets but I won't know if it worked until 
after our systems work.
