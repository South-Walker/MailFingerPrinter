Leon Payne, Ingrid's boss at Transco is resigning for personal reasons.  That kind of came as a surprise to everyone over there.  They supposedly have a reorg thing going on over there too.  Don't know if that's it or not.   The lease at the tower is up ?next year? I think.  The new CEO said staying in the tower is their first choice but they want to lease 20 floors instead of 40.  If that doesn't work, then they may move West to Beltway 8 somewhere.
