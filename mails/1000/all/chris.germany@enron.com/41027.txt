Attached are my calculations of the IF volumes for CGAS.  I will also try to 
update this schedule for the AGL production area volumes.  

I have also included the CGAS NX1 deals.  I feel good about the NX1 volumes 
for Jan and Feb, I not sure about the Mar forward volumes yet.  I will keep 
working on thei sheet.
