Kathy, we have a deal on Trunkline where Midland can request up to an additional 1,700 per day and it could be just 1 day over the weekend too.  Reliant has storage that can flow into Trunkline Wla.  We don't have a pricing mechanism in place so its pretty much automatic and Reliant can bill us whatever they want.  If it ever happens on the weekend, Jim and I will discuss the pricing the following Monday.  Its only happened once in the last 2 months but YOU NEVER KNOW, especially if it happens on the weekend.

If I remember correctly, Midland would call Kevin and Kevin would call Reliant.  Are we sill set up that way?
