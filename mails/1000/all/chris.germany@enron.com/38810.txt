Where are the actuals coming from?  Is this someone changing the supply 
matched up with the Clinton deal?

Chris,

 I am showing an adjustment coming through for deal #320094 that is reducing 
the invoice by 1,709 dth (from 13,551 to 11,842).  Clinton already agreed 
with 13,551 dth and paid us as of August 25.  I was wanting to make sure that 
this change is correct.  Could you please look at this for me and let me know 
what you find out?
