Subject: Stingray Agency



We are agent for Enterprise, Petsec, and Pennzoil (Devon) on Stingray.  Petsec
and Pennzoil (Devon) are filling out the appropriate forms and should send to
you for your signature today.  There in nobody at Enterprise to sign the
form.   I am still working with Stingray regarding the agency between Enron 
and
CES.  I thought this was taken care of but maybe not.  I am working with a
backup that is confusing.  I will follow up.  In summary, I think Enron will
have to nominate on CES contracts because I do not feel all this will get done
today.  Especially, Enterprise Oil.
