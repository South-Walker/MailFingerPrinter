I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on 
CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a 
navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he 
has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle 
this for him.

Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES?
