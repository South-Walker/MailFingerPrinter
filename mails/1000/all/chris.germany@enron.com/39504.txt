Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.  She laughed when I said gave 
her the volume of 100,000.  The most she will consider is 50,000.  So I told 
her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in 
demand charges each month.  She needs to think about it.  I'm out tomorrow 
but I will call her.

Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed 
fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next.
