Hey there.  I did get your message and yes we did wire $26,000.00 yesterday that is for a gas prepayment.  Pete sent me an email earlier this week asking for a confirmation number from our treasury department of the wires we make.  I like that idea and I'm still working on getting the info to add to my worksheet.

thanks.

Hello Chris,

Melissa in our Accounting Dept. left me a message that and even
$26,000.00 came in yesterday.  I wanted to check with you whether or not
it is a gas prepayment.  Please let me know at your earliest
convenience, and I will let her know.

Thanks,

Shawn
