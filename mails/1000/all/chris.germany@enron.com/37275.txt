Actually, I need all of them because I can't tell what these items are for.  I will highlight the items that I think need to go out and put this report on your desk, can't be that many of them.  But I would still need the invoices to see what these items are for.

I have the gas Sales Invoice List Report that you just gave Phil, I think.  Would it be possible to format this with the deal numbers, or give me the invoices so I can see the deal numbers?

Thanks
