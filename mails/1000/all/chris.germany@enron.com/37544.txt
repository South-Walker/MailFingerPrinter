I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.

Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?

Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.

I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.
