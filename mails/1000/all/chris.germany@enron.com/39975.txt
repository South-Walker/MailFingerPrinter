Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!  Sorry - that was just running thru my 
head.  I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.

Transport
I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st, 
all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located 
at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the 
retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.

Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset 
management deals. Ex.  Tennessee MUNi's.  How many of these are there??  Good 
question.

Good Luck

Have fun ;)
