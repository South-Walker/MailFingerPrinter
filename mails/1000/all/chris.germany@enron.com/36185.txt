Sorry guys, I have more questions.

For Dec 2001, how many producers were supplying this gas for ENA?  for EES? (doesn't have to be exact)

If possible, how many meter's are there supplying this gas?


I'm trying to put together information for the BTRC to show how detailed this activity is.  If someone from the BTRC just looked at the total volume, the price we need to pay the producer, and the price we can get for this gas today, the BTRC may decide that we need to pay the producers and sale the gas.

Hey team.  I'm putting some high level information together about the Dominion Producers and I have a couple questions.

First, the worksheet.
I'm using the information Dominin Fed X'd to us 2 weeks ago.  
Allocation Balance Report by production month.  The monthy receipt volume net of fuel in columns B through D on the worksheet.
Imbalance Signoff Sheet by accounting month.  The accumulated Dt Imbalance is in columns F through G on the worksheet.
Allocation Balance Report.  The total adjustment quanity by contract by accounting month is in columns J through L on the worksheet.

Questions
1.   The Dec 2001 receipt volumes seem very low.  I'm sure that high line pressure was keeping most of the production volume from flowing.  Did we lose any producers between Nov and Dec, before the gas flowed?

2.  I am assuming that most of this gas was priced at Index.  Do you agree?


Let me know if you have questions.  I'll probably have a few more for you two.

thanks
