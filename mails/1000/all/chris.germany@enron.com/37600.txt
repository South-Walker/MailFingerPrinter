We (EES) have been getting December production payments ready -- what are your thoughts on actually paying the post-petition pieces?   Besides Dominion, we have producers off of Gatherco, Columbia Natural Resources,  Columbia Gas Transmission, Peoples Natural Gas, and East Ohio Gas.    Are these on your list to review some day like you are doing Dominion?     A few producers have called wanting to know when to expect payment and I just need to know whether to forge ahead to get caught up in getting their payments in the system, or to wait in case we have the producers taken out of our pools on all these pipes/ldc's.   It is a ton of work, and if it doesn't need to happen, all the better, but if it does need to happen, I need to be working on it now.    
 
Also, only one company listed above could provide daily actuals so the others are just being split by 31 days.    I figured if the producer disputed his split (if paid), he could provide the back-up to make it more accurate.  
 
Any comments will be helpful.  Thanks.
