Yes, you should have Unify Estate access.  Your User Id is 
cgerman	

Try houston as your password.  You will be prompted to change it.

Let me know if you have any problems getting in.

I can vaguely remember you calling me about Unify.  Do I have Unify Estate access?  If yes, do you know my ID and password?  If no, how do I get it?


Thanks
