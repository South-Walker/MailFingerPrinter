I would much rather go and annoy your happy butt as much as possible.  Plus it make me feel like I'm doing part of the work.  I just might come up and spend the night tonight.  Be there around 10:30 or 11.

 You win!   How you want your $20.   How about in dimes, unrolled.    Don
said he  would go, but kinda hee hawing around.   I'm going so I don't have
to worry about Bonner having to wait on Don.   No sense in you going.
Just a quick trip up and back.   I'll pick me up a book to listen to on the
way.
