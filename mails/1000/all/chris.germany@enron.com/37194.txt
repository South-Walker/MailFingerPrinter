I'm not sure what you mean by valid.  We are not physically flowing any of this gas right now.  There are some small Appalachian producers on here that are still up in the air but we will probably reject those contracts anyway.

Chris,

Are these valid Sitara deals?? - can you tell us a little about them

I've attached the excel file - but some examples are Sitara no. 83618, 229971  etc
