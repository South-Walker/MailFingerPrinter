I think we chatted about this the other day.  I'm waiting to see if we 
actually get the retail deal before I send any notification.

Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb.  I wouldn't tell 
Steve its not a done deal yet.  Just tell him we are still working things out.

Since you never work anymore.... ha.. ha..... decided to e-mail you.

Where are we at in this process? Steve Stonestreet was asking me. He just 
doesn't want to upset the apple cart. Steve said that you've been calling him 
directly about questions, but he has not heard the official word fromTCO yet.

Thanks.
