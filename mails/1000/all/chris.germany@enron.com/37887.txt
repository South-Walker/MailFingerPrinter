Hey!  Congradulations on getting that new phone number.  I knew you could do it.  Would you ask Gerald Gilbert to call me when he gets a chance?  My number is 713-853-4743.  


Thanks

To All,
 
My bosses have been impressed with me so far, and for that gave me a phone, my new work number is 713-371-8581.
