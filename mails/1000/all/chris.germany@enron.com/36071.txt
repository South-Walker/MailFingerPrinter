Per yesterday's curves, Phil is showing that Tallahassee has a MTM value of $9,798,771.  Earlier, my cash requests showed a value of $1,500,000 as of 3/26/02.  

Phil's analysis below shows that the value of the Tallahassee deal was $3,388,467 using the curves on 3/26/02.  While the curve prices for 5/2002 through 10/2003 have increased, curve prices beyond 10/2003 have decreased.

I will attach Phil's worksheet showing current deal values to my cash request in the future.
