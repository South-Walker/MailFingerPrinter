Chris,

I'm right in the middle of imaging a PC. Please leave your power supply under your desk and I will come by around 2:30 and complete the install. Also, do you have any info on your Arm's request.

thanks,

My power cord came in for my spare pc.  Would you be able to hook it up?  I'm leaving today around 1:30 ish.

Thanks
