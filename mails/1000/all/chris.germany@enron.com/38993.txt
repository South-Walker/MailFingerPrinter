Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to 
Oglethorpe on Transco.

Current Process
ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily
ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.

New Process
ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 
318423, gas daily deal)
ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.  Curretly, this volume will 
match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the 
amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel.
