Columbia Gas sent me the December invoices via federal express.  The cover letter states that Columbia Gas is aware that ENA will not be paying the pre-petition amounts but that they expect full payment for the post-petition amounts.

I'm sending you a copy of the letter.  I assume that we will not be paying any of the invoice.

Any news on the Columbia Gas park & loans?

Thanks
chris
