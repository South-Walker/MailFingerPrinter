	As of 04/30/2002 it shows that:


				40 hours were carried over from last year.
				12 hours of vacation have been taken.
				188 hours of vacation are remnant.
				You have taken your discretionary holiday.
				Your have depleted your "unofficial vacation"
				You have 5 days (40 hrs) of paternity leave.
