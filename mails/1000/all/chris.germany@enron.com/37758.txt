I am micro-managing this deal and I don't want it to catch you by surprise.  If you look at my schedule for March, you will see that it is possible for ENA to have a negative cash balance with Reliant before I make the Thursday prepay based on the daily spike in prices.  I get the estimated prices from Jim.  Do you want me to make a prepayment on Wednesday or are you comfortable with the regular Thursday prepayment?  I need to know by tomorrow morning.  I have to request prepayments the day before the wire goes out.

Thanks
