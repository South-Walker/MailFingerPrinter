I am in receipt of several faxes from Dominion Transmission Inc which inform Enron of DTI's intention of not crediting gas from listed meters/producers to Enron's pool.  Per Dan Baney of DTI, the listed effective dates are dates as of which gas will not be credited.  In some cases, they are taking back gas previously allocated to the pool. 

While DTI is asking for a signoff from Enron agreeing to these statements, we have not sent any back.  I have forwarded all of these to you for handling along with the many other issues between Enron, DTI, and the affected producers.
