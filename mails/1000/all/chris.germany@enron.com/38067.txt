As of 2:00 P.M., Steve has not heard from Col Gas.

I will be taking my vacation through Monday, Jan 14th.  I have a sneaky feeling that I may be let go before then anyway.  I will be checking my voicemail everyday and my emails every other day.  Also, I don't plan on being out of town for more than a day over the next 2 weeks.  I may leave town a few days during the week of Jan 7th.
