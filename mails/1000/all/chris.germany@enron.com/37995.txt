This is very interesting.  It doesn't sound legal unless SIGCORP agreed to pay for November upfront.  

Thanks for the info.

I spoke again this morning to Pamela Brumbaugh at Texas Gas Transmission about contract #T018176.       This contract was acquired by capacity release from SIGCORP ENERGY.    Since ENA failed to pay the bill for November 2001 production,   then TGT's tariff allows them to go back to the original contract party -- SIGCORP ENERGY to get payment.    So TGT reversed the demand charges on our invoice and in turn sent an invoice to SIGCORP for this November 2001 production demand payment.    Thus it would appear that eventually ENA would have to make payment to SIGCORP Energy,   but as this winds thru the bankruptcy proceedings,  this issue will need to get clarified.

Chris Spears -- please put a copy of this email in your TGT files.
