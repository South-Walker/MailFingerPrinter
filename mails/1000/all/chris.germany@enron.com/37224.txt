Gentlemen,

	It is my understanding that Enron Representative Chris German
informed Tallahassee Representative Pam McCullers, earlier this morning that
Enron would not be scheduling gas to Tallahassee pursuant to subject
agreement for the month of June.  If this is indeed the case and Enron does
not schedule gas with Tallahassee by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Prevailing Time
tomorrow, May 31, 2002, Tallahassee will seek replacement supplies from
alternative sources.

	Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Pete Koikos, Director of Energy Services.
Sincerely,

Roger McDonald
