I spoke with Steve Stonestreet at Columbia Gas.  He will do a conference call with us tomorrow.  I told him it would probably be around our lunch time.  He said that is fine.  I can set up a time tomorrow.  His boss, Jeanne Adkins, told him she doesn't need to be there if we are just talking about the mechanics of how the producer gas flows.
