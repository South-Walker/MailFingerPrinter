For meter 77578 HPL, Elsa at AEP said the bid to buy gas and deliver to Centana is a non - Katy Tailgate price.  When people take gas out of Centana into HPL they try to get a Houston Ship Channel price.  I didn't tell Elsa what we were doing but I bet she could figure it out.

i spoke with sharon soderman at kn regarding receipt point into centana.

the quote for july 02 to aug 04 at midcon-spindletop is Inside Ferc Ship Channel flat for 10,000 dth/day.

of course, they can't transact with ena.
