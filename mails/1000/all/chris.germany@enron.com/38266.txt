Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.  Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I come!!!!!!!!!!

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.
