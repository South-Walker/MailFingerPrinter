Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a 
number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller 
pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde 
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF 
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell 
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde 
is going to check around.

Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet?
