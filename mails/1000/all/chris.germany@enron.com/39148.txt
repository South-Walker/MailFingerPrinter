We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we 
are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is 
paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.

Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the 
weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know.
