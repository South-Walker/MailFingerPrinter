Subject: Gift for Melissa


FYI - 
 
At the suggestion of Ed, I went ahead and sent Melissa a cookie bouquet for her whole family to enjoy.  If everyone gave $3.00 that 
would take care of it!  
 
I will be buying a card as well this weekend, we can sign it and send it to her house, to let her know we are thinking of her and wish 
her the best.
