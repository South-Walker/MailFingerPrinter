I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora 
on the National Fuel deal.  After adjusting for what we took out today, we 
owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth.

Here are the points that I believe will work best

Tenn/Colden (meter #060003)  Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can 
use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply.
Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072)  Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or 
Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG.
Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can 
redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost.
