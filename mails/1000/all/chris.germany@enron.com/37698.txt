I received your fax.

Questions:  at the top of the page from Dominion, it states that "effective FEBRUARY 2002 Production ... WILL NOT BE CREDITED".  One of the column titles on the sheet is EFFECTIVE DATE.  What does this effective date stand for.

Also, were you able to find a contract for The Central Pacific Group?
