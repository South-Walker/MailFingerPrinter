I'm here for you.  Just remember me favorably when you become my boss 
someday.  I fetch coffe and pop, I always keep a stash of crackers,... the 
list goes on.

sorry Chris, I know you already sent this to me.  I got lost here for a 
moment between the Nov corrections and the Dec invoice.


Thanks for your help!
