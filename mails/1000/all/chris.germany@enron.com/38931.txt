As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.
