Subject: Deal needs to be changed to Clinton Energy Management

Hey Chris,

 It is deal number 348443 that is set up as a sale (for Aug. - Nov.) to 
Clinton Gas Marketing and should be Clinton Energy Management.  I couldn't 
find the other supply numbers that you were asking about...  Could you get 
this changed in the system to reflect Clinton Energy Management?  Thanks...
