Just so you don't forget me.  I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.  I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.  Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.  I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.  Tom would like an answer by Monday.

Let me know.

Thanks
chris
