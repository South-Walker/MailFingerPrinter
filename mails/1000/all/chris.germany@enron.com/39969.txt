Subject: January 2000 AGT volumes

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.
