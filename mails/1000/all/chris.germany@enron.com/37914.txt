Reliant has indicated that we must use their paper - this point is non-negotiable.

Kay, we will not wire any funds to Reliant until we have your approval of the contract.  I understand that you are also working on a gas contract with TXU.  We need one of these contracts in place so we can buy gas tomorrow morning, it doesn't matter which contract we have in place first.

Doug, Phil, Eric,
The prepayment that we were going to send to Reliant may be going to TXU instead.  We are coming dangerously close to defaulting on the Tallahassee contract.  Robin and I are going to work on a prepayment request for TXU after lunch.
