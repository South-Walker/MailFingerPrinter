I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for 
June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in 
the end of the month.

On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth.
On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.

This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.
