It looks like Cornerstone Propane, L.P. has not paid their December invoice for physical or financial.  Is there anything going on with them that you guys are aware of?

Neither of these companies have paid us for December 2001 gas.  MidAmerica is probably holding payment for forward value, I don't know about Cornerstone.  Both had invoices sent to them for December sales.  Attached is Cornerstone's SAP balance.  Call me if you need any further information.
