Ecuador is a must for any of you who like mountains, waterfalls, monkeys and fried guinea pig!

As I getting back up to speed on the last week in the Gas industry I see falling prices and widening spreads on Niagara to Leidy which explains why I only have 18,000 available on IT from Niagara to Leidy with another 10,000 available from Pendleton to Leidy.

40,000 dth for excess injections and 100,000 dth for excess withdrawals.
