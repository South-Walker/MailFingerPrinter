I just spoke with the lawyer.  We can't do anything until the end of 
September.  Then, if no one contest the will, I will go to court on a Friday 
morning and be appointed executor.  She said there needs to be 2 witnesses ( 
and the sons count, so does Mary) to testify that the signature on the will 
is Dad's.
