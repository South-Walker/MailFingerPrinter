I don't think I ever saw the breakout on the access area since we didn't get 
this via capacity release.

I'm here for you - NOT.

Hey there!!!!

I need your help.

Can you tell me the distribution of VNG's TX Eastern contract?

How much is from WLA, ELA, STX, ect.  I know we no longer have the capacity
past Oct., but I still need the breakout.

Thanks,
Maria
