I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).  This is a sale to Transco at 
St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.  I also entered a transport usage deal 
399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.  This deal captures the commodity 
cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.

Comments/Questions?
