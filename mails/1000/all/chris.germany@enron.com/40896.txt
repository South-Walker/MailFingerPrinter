Just looking high level, I see 3 days where storage is off by more than 1,000 
dt's that I will check into.

Date Sitara  Jeff's 
24th 54245  55720 
26th 25058  32794
28th 39388  40053

I don't understand your storage number on the 16th.  Does that mean you 
banked gas that day?

Also, I setup a column for Navigator numbers and it looks like we took out 
66,000 for ENA.

I need to reconcile storage back to Nov so I can track what we took out vs. 
what we pay New Power for.
