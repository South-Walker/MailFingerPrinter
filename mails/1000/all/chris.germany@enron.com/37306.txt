Subject:	Results of the Bankruptcy Hearing for TCO's  Issues With EES

Here is a quick update on how the Columbia Gas Transmission,TCO, bankruptcy hearing went last week for the EES issues:

TCO agreed to withdraw the portion of their motion that was associated with EES.  The pipeline admitted that EES has been using their transport contracts and have been paying their bills since the bankruptcy petition date.
The $2.1 million claim that TCO had been including in the Enron "set off amount" (i.e. the remaining demand charges for EES's agreements until the end of the contract terms) was pulled out TCO's Motion.
The minimum OBA/pooling agreement monthly balance should no longer be required by the pipeline (Note:  Originally TCO appeared to be using EES's minimum balance to set off ENA & EES obligations). 

I would recommend that you challenge TCO's operations folks, if they continue to say that EES must be keeping a minimum balance in your OBA.  If you have any problems, please let me know and I will get our outside counsel involved again.

Thanks,
Ruth Concannon
