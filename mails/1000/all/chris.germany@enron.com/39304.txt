All 3 of the TCO schedulers are back today and Joanie said she will get me an 
updated storage worksheet with the Choice information.

Also, Scott Goodell, Molly Johnson, Jeff Westover, and I are having lunch 
with Don and Ernie today.  We will be giving them the Feb (and maybe some 
March) invoices.
