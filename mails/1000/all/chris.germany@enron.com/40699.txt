Robin Barbe did a long term sale to EES.  The volume is 1200 dt/day.  EES has 
the option of taking delivery at Tenn Zone 5, meter #20816 or on CNG 
(Dominion), meter DOMSP.  The contract price to EES is the same at both 
locations.

Deal 624140 is the sale on Tenn.  EES requested the volumes on CNG effective 
3/23/2001.  I created deal 686905 for the sale on EES.  

Kimat, I assume the CNG will need to hedged.
