We can do that.  Brian, would you mail Don a copy of the CGAS and CGLF 
invoices for January?  We will take care of everything else.

thanks

Subject: Transport Invoices



Don Kirkendahl (in your Houston office 713-350-8445) contacted me yesterday.  
He
is requesting copies of the transport invoices.  Should I give the invoices to
him or should I send them to Charlie?
