I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.  please let me know 
when you validate these or what else you need.

Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.  Did this have a big 
p&l impact?  My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF.

Subject: CGAS storage/exchange deal tickets for Nov-Mar

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.
