Tallahassee called on the gas for the weekend.  I had planned for that in my numbers but I had no idea prices would go up $.07 - $.11 for the weekend - my fault.  This makes my cash balance at Reliant short by about $130.00 if prices post on the high side.  My trading contact at Reliant said that his credit department DOES NOT want to work with us at all.  My contact said his credit department could force him to cut the deal.  We won't know until this afternoon or Monday.  So please try to get the wire out today.

Thanks
