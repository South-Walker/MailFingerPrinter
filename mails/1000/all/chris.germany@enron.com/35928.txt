Hey team.  We won't be selling TXU any gas probably until Saturday.

FYI, my good buddy Kevin Brady is going to start doing the nominations on Lone Star, just as soon as I can find where he's sitting.

The plant used 39,880 MMBtu yesterday (5/7/02) from 7:00 am to 7:00 am. I feel comfortable of nominating the entire 45,000 MMBtu, at least until and through Friday.
