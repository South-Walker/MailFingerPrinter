Subject: Capacity Releases


I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity.  
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years 
provided the releases are recallable for any reason.  This recall right is 
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines 
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)

So....

Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.
