OK, I never get to talk to Ruth because SHE IS ALWAYS ON THE PHONE.  And I bet she's on the phone with Shemin too!!!

Should we all get together and make a conference call to Dominion like we did before or should I just call Jeff Davis myself?  Our last call was Iris Kind, Bill Savier(sp?), and Jeff Davis.
