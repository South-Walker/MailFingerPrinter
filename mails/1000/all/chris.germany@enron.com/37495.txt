Chris, which desks do you want to look at?  I can print all even though there are zeroes on most of them.

Jeanne,

Would you mind reviewing the P&L reports with Sabra.  Kim used to check there reports after flash, and Sabra will begin taking over those responsibilities.

Appreciate your help!

I can't find any of the reports that Kim Olinger used to run out of Unify.  BUT, Jeanne Wukasch was in Kim's group and she would know how to run them.  I believe they were called Service P&L reports.  The only thing we would use them for now are transport demand charges.
