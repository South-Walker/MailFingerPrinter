Hey Uncle, 
Thank you guys for the email and thanks for coming to the ordination ceremony.  How did your interview go?  We will be in town this Monday or Tuesday night.  Tuesday would probably be easier on us, because we will be driving back in from Dallas on Monday, but either would work fine. 
Just let us know. 
God bless you guys. 
Chad and Angela
