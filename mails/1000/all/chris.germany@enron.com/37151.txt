Bryant Baker at Bridgeline is asking me to approve this deal so Bridgeline can bill ENA for the storage service.  Normally I wouldn't worry about it but since we are in negotiations with Bridgeline I'm not sure what to do.

Is a confirm generated if I approve this ticket?

Also, when does this deal terminate in the global contracts system?

thx
