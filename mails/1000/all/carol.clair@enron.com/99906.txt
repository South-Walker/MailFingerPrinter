We are planning to hold another informal lunch this coming Friday in 
Conference Room 38C2 from 12-1:30 to go over in more depth how the ISDA 
Master and ISDA Credit Support Annex works.  If you are interested in 
attending, could you please contact my assistant, Suzanne Adams at 37340 
TODAY so that she can get a head count for lunch.  Thanks and sorry about the 
short notice.
