Pablo and Jose:
Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received
from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going
forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to 
receiving
you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe on Wednesday
of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least outline any 
potential
online issues, both in connection with our marketing efforts and in connection
with the online documents that you are reviewing? I am available anytime after
2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide open on Thursday.
