Peggy:
I work in the ENA legal group  - financial trading section.  One of our legal 
assistants recently left our group and I was wondering if you might be 
interested in interviewing for this position.  I received a copy of your 
resume from Joyce Dorsey.  If you are interesred, could you please call me at 
33989?  Thanks.
