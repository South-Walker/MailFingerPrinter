Jason:
Thanks for doing this.  Mark and I met with Bill Bradford today and it sounds 
like we will be sending out quite a few of these so I will take a look at it 
and give you my comments shortly.

Sara and Carol,

Attached for your review, please find a draft of a letter to be distributed 
by ENA to Counterparties who are either (i) in Default or (ii) over the 
Collateral Threshold and for which ENA does not desire to call such default 
or demand such collateral.  Should you have any comments, please let me know.

Jason
