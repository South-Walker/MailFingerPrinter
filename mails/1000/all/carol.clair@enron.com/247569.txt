Lisa:
Enclosed are the latest drafts of:

1. The ENA/Kaiser Schedule for the call spread transaction
2. The ENA/Kaiser Schedule for the other derivatives transactions
3. The ENA/Broker Schedule
4. The Call Spread confirm

All of these docs are in my directory under specproj/wilhelm.  Feel free to 
leave me voice mail messages if any issues come up and if absolutely 
necessary, Mark is available to answer any questions.
