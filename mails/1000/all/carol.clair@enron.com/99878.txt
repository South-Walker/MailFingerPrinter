Dave:
I will check with Tana on this and yes, she will handle the notifications.

Carol,

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. 
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana 
be handling the change notification?

Dave
