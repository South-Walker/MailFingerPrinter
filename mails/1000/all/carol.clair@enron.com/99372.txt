Laurie:
Thanks so much for your support.  I will have Bill drop your campaign stuff 
off at your house.  We are having a boyn and I have less than 3 months to 
go!  So far so good, although as of today, no more running and no more trips 
out of town.  Hope you are doing well.  Did you ever sell your baby stuff?  
If not, we may still be interested.
Carol
