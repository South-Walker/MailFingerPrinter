Suzanne:
That's a trick question which I will not answer!!  I have been getting as 
much sleep as Charles will let me for short periods of time.  It's really not 
too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.  I'm still 
breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula 
so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house 
for lunch most of the time.  I'm still running/walking in the mornings and 
with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.  I just can't stay in the 
house all day and night.  Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled 
him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.  He has really shown an interest in 
tennis and i hope it continues.  I hope to get back on the court in a few 
weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably 
because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.

Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although 
there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to 
me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are 
sick of each other.  Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.

Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I 
can find a time that works.  I'll let you know.  I'm really sorry to hear 
about Jim Grace's baby.  Please keep me posted.  It makes me appreciate more 
what we have.

Have you been doing too much or just not getting any sleep?
