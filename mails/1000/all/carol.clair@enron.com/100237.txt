Elizabeth:
Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner.  Can you give me your home number?  I 
think that weekends would be easier to schedule since weekdays are still 
fairly hectic.  I'll call you soon.  How about this heat?  Fortunately, I've 
been playing early in the mornings or late at night so it's not too bad.  
I've also am hooked on watching the Open every day - a fringe benefit to 
maternity leave.  Tonight should be great.  I hope one of the Williams' gets 
beat.  talk to you soon.

Hi Carol!

Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
(hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.

See you soon
