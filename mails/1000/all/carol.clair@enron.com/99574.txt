David:
I spoke with Tanya this morning and she is going to check with her people to 
see if this change really needs to be made.

According to Bruce Mills in our group,

We have contacted Merrill Lynch Captial Services to retrieve our outstanding 
confirms.

They have indicated that they want the fixed price (nymex) language changed 
to reflect
"floating" price language and wants all deals which we are confirming changed 
immediately
and refaxed to them.

Please advise,

David
