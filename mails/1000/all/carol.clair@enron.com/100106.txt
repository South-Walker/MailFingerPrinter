Jaime:
when are you planning on sending this out?  I'm checking with Mark on this 
but I thought that we would wait until we had seen our counsel's memo before 
we would issue a press release or send these letters out.  Is that the plan?  
Given the ramifications of a press release, I want Mark's input on what it 
says and when it should be sent out.
