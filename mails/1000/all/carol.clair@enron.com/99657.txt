Susan:
FYI.  Ignore the Enron Guaranty but make sure that the PSE&G Guaranty that 
you eventually get conforms to this.

Maria:
I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and
probably
the PSE&G Guaranty:

1.   Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware
corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its
successors and assigns

2.   In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up
amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads
:"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged
between
the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements,
replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")

Let me know if you have a problem with this.
