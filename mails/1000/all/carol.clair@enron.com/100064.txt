Claudio:
Leslie Hansen in the power group is going to help me on this.  She is not 
available to meet until next Wednesday so I have asked my secretary to set up 
a meeting for then.

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Claudio
