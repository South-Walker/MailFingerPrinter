John:
I understand from Tana Jones that we are going to try to put an ISDA in place 
today.  We should be sending you the draft shortly.  Please call me directly 
with any comments or questions that you may have.  Please pass the 
information below  to anyone else that may be working on this from your end.  
Thanks.  I look forward to hearing from you.
