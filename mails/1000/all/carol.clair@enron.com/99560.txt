John:
As we discussed, here is a draft of a proposed amendment letter which covers 
the issues that we talked about.  Depending upon how Leslie handles the 
affiliate issue, more may be added to this.  Alos, as I ,mentioned to you, 
this needs to be approved by the head of our Online group before I can sign 
off on it.  I am in the process o getting that approval.
