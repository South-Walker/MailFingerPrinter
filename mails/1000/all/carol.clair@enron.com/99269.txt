Mark:
Just 2 thoughts on the new draft:

1. In the definition of Global Early Termination Date, how does this work 
with the new Section 16 concept that Alicia has added to the Schedules 
whereby the termination of Transactions that raise Section 16 problems may be 
delayed?

2. Does Section 5.06 conflict at all with the proviso in the Limitation of 
Liability sections of both Schedules?
