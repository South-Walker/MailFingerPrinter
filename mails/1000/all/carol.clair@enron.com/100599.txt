Mark, Sara and Mary:
Jim would like to talk to someone about problems he is having with his 
customers concerning the ISDA and CSA forms.  Apparently, most of his 
customers feel that it is too complicated and Jim would like to see if any 
alternatives exist.  Could someone please contact him?  Thanks.
