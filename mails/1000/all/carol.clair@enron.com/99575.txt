Frank:
I have sent your responses to Stacy Dickson and Jeff Hodge so that they can 
verify the physical questions.  With respect to question #3, I would alos 
state that until the Master is executed, all of those trades will be governed 
by the online GTC.  Also, to the extent that Cargill traded with Enron Canada 
on a financial basis, those trades would alos be confirmed under the Master 
as it is my understanding taht we do not do separate Masters with the same 
counterparty for ENA and ECC.
