Bill:
You can spend all weekend doing it, but one of us needs to be at his game and 
I will  not be able to make a 6 o'clock game.  Could you please skip 
Wednesday?  Alos, if Chelsea cannot do Monday, who will?  Also, as we have 
discussed previuosly, I would prefer not to handle these types of discussions 
by e-mail.  Please call me or talk to me when we are at home.  This is not a 
practice that I think is in the best interests of either of us to continue.
Carol
