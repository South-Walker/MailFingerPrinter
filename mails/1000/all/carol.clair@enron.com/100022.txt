Henry:
Enron has signed this CA and I have sent it back to Janet.  We have a number 
of questions to ask about the schedule and credit matters and Janet requested 
that we contact you.  Would it be possible to set up a time to talk?  I will 
be tied up from 1:30-3:30 Houston time, but am otherwise available.  Please 
call me or Russell Diamond at 713-345-7095.

		 Subject: Confidentiality Agremeement- Enron


Carol - Here is a revised confidentiality agreement for review per our
discussion. To simplify the questions on Eqt. Energy's agency role, I set it
up so it and Equitable Production would both sign. Hopefully, this is
acceptable. Thanks. Henry (412-553-7711).
