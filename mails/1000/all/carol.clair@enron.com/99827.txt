Carol,

I spoke with David Forster about the procedures for the auction and the 
possibility to include a different GTC.  According to him this should not be 
an issue and that we don't need to get Mark Taylor's approval, as this has 
already been cleared by him for other transactions.  I am going to meet with 
the EOL people again and I will forward you and the team any changes in the 
procedures if they arise.

Gaurav
