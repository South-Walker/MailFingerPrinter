Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Kay
