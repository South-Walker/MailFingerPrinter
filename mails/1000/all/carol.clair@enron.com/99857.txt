 Susan:
Regarding Kate's e-mail, I have left a voice mail for Richard Sanders as to 
which office we should designate.  If you need to send out the ISDA draft 
before I hear back from him and before Kate hears back from Canada, go ahead 
and leave the address blank and we can fill it in later.
Carol
