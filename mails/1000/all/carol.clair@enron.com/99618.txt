I'm pretty flexible.  The only days that appear to be bad if its done during 
lunch would be Friday, June 2 and Friday, June 16th.  As for ideas, I have 
NOTHING right now, but i know that Julia has some used stuff that she is 
going to give me.  We are planning on buying the furniture before the end of 
May.  As for the rest, I really hope to have all of that bought before the 
middle of June just in case.

Fabulous news!!!!!!!!!!!   Julia just called and they are wanting to do a 
baby shower for you.  I told her that I thought you needed to pick the date 
since you have so much going on.  Just thought I'd give you the heads up so 
you can be thinking of a date.  We would do it up here.  You also need to be 
thinking about what you need because people are going to be asking!

I'm so excited about the baby!!!!!!  We had a great time!!!!!

Suzanne:
Welcome back!  How was your trip?  Stop by when you get a chance or we can 
talk about it tomorrow at lunch.  We got great news yesterday - the placenta 
is gradually moving to the right place and it appears as if I am out of the 
"danger" zone.  The baby is in the right position now and is a little over 4 
pounds so I am very, very happy and relieved.  Your good vibes are working.  
I'll see my other doctor on Thursday and confirm everything with him but if 
Ric sees me now on the treadmill at the club, tell him not to worry!  (Just 
kidding - I'm not sure I could run now even if I wanted to).  talk to you 
soon.

P.S. - How can I find out about where I stand currently re unused vacation 
time?

Carol
