Carolyn:
Thanks.  I'm going to assume that it came from Anne.

I believe the gift is either from Anne or Tana.  I over heard Mary H. say she 
had to take her daughter to the doctor this morning and during the morning 
confusion did not get out the house with her baby gift for you.  Mark Taylor 
made a contribution through Sara, that I was not aware of.  He should have 
been on the list of group contributors.
