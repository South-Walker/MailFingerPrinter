(i)  Section 5(b)(ii) of the Agreement is amended by adding the following\
language at the end of clause (2) thereof and before the semicolon therein:\
\
=10_g(a =10_gNet Payment=10_h), provided, however, that, in the event of th=\
e receipt\
by a party of a Net Payment due to the failure of a Tax to be an\
Indemnifiable Tax because of a present or former connection between the\
jurisdiction of the government or taxation authority imposing such Tax and\
the recipient of such payment or a person related to such recipient, the\
relevant date referred to in clause (x) and (y) above shall be the date\
which is sixty days prior to the date on which a Transaction is entered\
into (rather than the date on which a Transaction is entered into)=10_h.\
