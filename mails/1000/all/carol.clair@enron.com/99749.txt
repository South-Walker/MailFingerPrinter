Suzanne:
I may be in tomorrow but I will leave you a voice mail message one way or 
another.  If I don't come in and I haven't used my discretionary day, please 
use that, otherwise treat it as a vacation day.  Hope you have a great 
weekend.  Be safe!  If it is slow tomorrow afternoon, I have no problem with 
you leaving around 4:30 or so.
Carol
