Steve:
It has come to my attention that we made need another agreement similar to 
the one that we did with the ANNEX A form to cover the GTC's that Puget is 
bound by when it trades online with us.  I have enclosed the online GTC.  It 
is very similar to Annex A but I think that we need to deal with it 
separately.  Let me know what you think.
