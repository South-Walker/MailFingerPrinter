Louise and Mark:
Union Oil's only issue relates to their concern about the long descriptions 
on the Website and how conflicts between terms used in such descriptions and 
terms that are defined in the Master are resolved.  Their attorney has 
already reviewed the long descriptions and is still not comfortable with the 
language in the ETA.  She would however be comfortable allowing the terms in 
the long description control if such terms are used in the confirmations that 
they receive for each trade.  Would this be an acceptable approach to take?
