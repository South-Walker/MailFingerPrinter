Susan:
I hope to finalize the Master today on our conference call.  Could you please 
start pulling together the ENA and Enron Corp certificates?  They are alos 
requesting a W-9.  I would like to have all of these ready and executed by 
this time next week.  I will send you the Enron Guaranty after it has been 
finalized.  Thanks.  Call if you have any questions.  My contacts there are 
Adele Raspe and Maria Salvatore, her legal assistant.
