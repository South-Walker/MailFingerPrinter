Leslie:
I left in your chair comments/questions I had on what you drafted.  Some of 
my comments may reflect my inability to understand exactly what we are 
doing.  When you send this around, could you please send a copy to Joe Hunter 
on the confirms desk?  Alos, Rod Nelson is our credit person.  Finally, on 
the LeBeouf side, please include Bruce Wright in addition to Scott, John and 
Sam.  Bruce's e-mail address is pwright@llgm.com.  Thanks.
Carol
