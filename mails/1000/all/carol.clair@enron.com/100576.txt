Hi Carol! Congratulations on the "new" baby (now probably all grownup),
enjoyed reading about him in your Christmas card. That week I'm out the
14th and 15th on vacation. Look forward to seeing everyone, M.

Midge and Janet:
We are trying to organize a lunch for the week of June 11th.  What days are
good for you?
