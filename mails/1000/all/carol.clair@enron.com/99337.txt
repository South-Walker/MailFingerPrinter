Enclosed is the Stratus Ca that we discussed earlier.  Here are the main 
differences between our agreement and theirs:

1. Our term is 1 year.
2. Our agreement resolves disputes by arbitration, although it allows them to 
go to a court to obtain injunctive relief.
3. Our agreement has a much narrower definition of Confidential Information 
4. Our agreement has no "use" restriction
5. Our agreement has different procedures for returning/destroying 
confidential information.


I will have hand delivered to Lucy the CA on ENA letterhead with my initials.
