After our meeting yesterday, I asked Mark Taylor whether under the revised 
version of the CEA there was any restriction on one's ability to cash settle 
physical transactions.  He confirmed that so long as the parties to the 
transaction are "Eligible Contract Participants", then there is no 
restriction and our physical contracts can expressly permit cash settlement.  
Enclosed is a summary of the ECP definition.
