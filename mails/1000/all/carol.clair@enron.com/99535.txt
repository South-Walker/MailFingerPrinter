Joyce:
I am working on the ETA amendment letter which I hope to send to you 
shortly.  We have a new procedure here where every amendment needs to be 
signed off by the head of the Online group so I need to get their blessing 
before I send it on to you.  Since most if not all of our issues were more 
legal in nature I don't foresee a problem with this.
