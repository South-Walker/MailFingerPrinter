I saw it twice with Arthur and then he saw it once with my dad!  We've also 
seen "Meet the parents" twice and Bill took his mom to see it this week.  
It's really good.

I forgot to tell you that they had Big Momma's House on the plane to Vegas.  
It was hysterical.  Ric had to tell me to quiet down!  It was so funny!
