Mark, Julia and Kristina:
We are planning to have Charles baptized on Sunday, September 24th and are 
having a luncheon at our house afterwards from 12-2.  My parents and younger 
sister will be in town and I would love for you to be able to meet them as 
well as see Charles of course.  I will be mailing invitations shortly, but 
thought that I would give you some advanced notice.  Don't worry if you can't 
make it as there will be plenty more opportunities to see Charles and of 
course you are always welcome to come out to the house for a visit.  Take 
care and see you soon I hope.

Carol
