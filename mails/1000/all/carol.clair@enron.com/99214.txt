Joe and David:
Both Williams and Richardson Products have the typical confirmation process 
language in their ISDA's where we send out the confirms and they have 3 days 
to object.  The Williams Master is governed by NY law and Richardson by Texas 
law so we are safer under the Williams Master if they are not signing.  With 
respect to Morgan Stanley, we are the confirming party.  The Master was 
amended to provide a procedure for them indicating their acceptance of the 
confirm other than by signing it and it involves them sending us a letter 
stating that they approve of the confirm.  I will send copies of the 
amendment and letter to you.
