Mary:
Enclosed is the form of Enron Guaranty that we would propose using for 
multi-products.  Again, like the counterparty form that I sent around 
earlier,  this form will need to be modified depending upon the products that 
need to be covered and the parties involved.  Please distribute as 
appropriate to the credit group.
