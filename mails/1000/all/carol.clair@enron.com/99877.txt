Carolyn:
I'm hoping that you can help me with this.  One  of the gifts that I received 
on Friday was 2 outfits from Baby Gap.  There was no card.  The only people 
that were at the shower that I couldn't account for based on the gifts that I 
received with cards and group gift list that I saw were Anne Yaeger, Mark 
Taylor, Tana Jones and Mary Heinitz.  Could you please confirm for me that 
these people did not participate on the group gift?  Thanks.
Carol
