Harry:
FYI.  Is there anyone else that needs to sign off on this before we roll this 
form out?

Carol:

At long last I have had an opportunity to review the Multi-Purpose Form of 
Guaranty you circulated in early June.  I am fine with that form as something 
that we can use and that Credit can send to counterparties.

As an aside, the attached e-mail indicates that you forwarded something 
yesterday.  If so, I did not see that.

I join in Leslie's request to be forwarded a copy of the final form of 
guarantee.  Should you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 
your convenience.

Thanks,

Jeff

As we discussed, Elizabeth and I are fine with the Cross-Commodity Guarantee 
you circulated yesterday.  (By the way, we are revising our current physical 
power guarantee to eliminate the 15-day cure period.)  One question:  Is ENA 
the proper notice recipient in Section 7?  We direct notice to Enron Corp. in 
our standard form.  

After you have received Jeff's (et al.)  feedback, please send me a copy of 
the final form of cross-commodity guarantee so that we can include in our 
form file for all requests.

Thanks,

Leslie
