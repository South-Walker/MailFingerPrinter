Susan and Samantha:
This is a file that apparently Shari worked on and Susan Flynn gave to me.  I 
have resolved the last tax issue and I will mark up the existing draft which 
then should be ready to sign.  There are some Guaranty issues that I need to 
take care of but in the meantime I will need one of you to revise the draft 
and coordinate getting it signed by the counterparty.

Carol
