Very funny!  What do you want it to say?  What kind of cake would you like.  
I'm not sure of my choices.  

GOOD LUCK IN LONDON!

How does that sound!

Let's do a cake so long as there is no mention of "retirement".

I see on the party information that they will do personalized cakes requested 
in advance.  Do you want to do that or just go with their dessert selection?  
Haven't heard from MT re champagne.
