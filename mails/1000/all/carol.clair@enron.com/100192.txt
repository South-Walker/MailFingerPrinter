Carol,

Tim Reyes of Alcoa would like to make sure that their current master 
agreement with Enron will encompass trading metal products, specifically, 
aluminum products on EOL.  I am hoping that you are the correct person to 
answer his question.

If you require more information Please contact Mr. Reyes at 865-594-4734.

Thank you,

Noel
