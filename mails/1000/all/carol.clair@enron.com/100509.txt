Ed:
Rudwell and I would like to talk to you about the form of Trade Guaranty 
Agreement that has been sent to us.  Specifically, we need some clarification 
on how Section 5 works since some new language has been added to the June 1, 
1999 form that we received.  Please call me at your convenience to discuss 
this.
