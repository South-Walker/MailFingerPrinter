Paul:
Just a few questions for you on the revised EEI master that we received from 
Engage today:

1. I just want to confirm that the collateral thresholds should be 9 million.

2. They want to have Section 8.1(b) and 8.2(b) apply which requires a party 
to post collateral if the other party believes that its creditworthiness is 
unsatisfactory.

2. In our Schedule, we delete the 3 day cure period for an event of default 
that occurs as a result of a Guarantor's non-payment.  They want the cure 
period.  do you care?

3. In Section 5.7, each party can suspend performance if a Potential Event of 
Default or an Event of Default occurs. They want to delete Potential Event of 
Default.

4. They want to extend the right to dispute invoices and to request 
adjustments to statements or payments from 12 months to 18 months.

5. They want to change the consent to assignments standard from being able to 
withhold consent in one's sole discretion to being able to withhold consent 
only when it is reasonable to do so.

I look forward to hearing from you.
