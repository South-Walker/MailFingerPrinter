Russell:
I have reviewed your comments to the ISDA and CSA schedules.  I need to check 
with our credit person to see how he wnats to handle the Independent Amount 
issue.  On collateral substitutionh consent rights, given the fact that we 
can only choose between cash and LC's is consent really necesssary?  We would 
prefer to be able to freely substitiute.  Let me know what you think.
