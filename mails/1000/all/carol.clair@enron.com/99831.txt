Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.
