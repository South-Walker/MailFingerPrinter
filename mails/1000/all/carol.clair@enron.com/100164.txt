		 Subject: buying a web site

Carol,

The owner of the following website:   www.weatherrisk.com   has offered to 
sell the site to us.  We currently own www.weather-risk.com and would like to 
get rid of the "-" if we could.  We have tentatively negotiated a price of 
$15,000 for this site.  I would like to sit down with you to discuss our next 
steps, concerns, issues, etc... at your earliest convenience.

Please call me to discuss this or to schedule time.

Thanks and regards,
Gary Taylor
