Suzanne:
Just saw the org chnages memo.  Seems like alot has been going on.  Would you 
mind mailing the memo and charts to me?  For some reason, our computer does 
not print out charts.  How are you doing?  I'm doing great although I wish we 
knew who our next president is going to be.  I played tennis with Elizabeth 
Sager yesterday.  She is really good and I hope we get to play more.  I'll 
give you a call maybe later today or tomorrow.  Take care.
