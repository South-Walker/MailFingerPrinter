Jeff:
I spoke with Derek Davies.  He claimed that he knew nothing about his request 
to us not to send the Annex A letter to the latest set of Canadian 
counterparties and I made him check his e-mail for the messages that I sent 
him some time ago which he did.  Anyway, he had not yet spoken with these 
counterparties but promised to do so.
