Marie:
I left Mary Gosnell a message making sure that she was of what we are doing 
and that she needed to provide you with any additional new counterparties 
that we have done trades with since last weeks list was compiled.  Alos, 
could you please give Bob Bowen a call later today or first thing tomorrow if 
we haven't heard from him?  Finally, it's my understanding that the 
comparison Annex A that we will attach to the letter will be the new Annex A 
that has been compared to the old annex a with the name change.  Thanks.
Carol
