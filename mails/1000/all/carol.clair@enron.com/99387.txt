Donald:
Thanks for your e-mail and phone mail message. It would be very helpful to us 
if we could talk to someone at Gardere Wynne although I understand how 
difficult that may be given your situation.  Could you please give it some 
more thought and if you could come up with someone let me know.  In the 
meantime, I will call your other references.
Carol
