Tanya:
Thanks for your message.  All El Paso wants to put in the LC form is language 
that states that the original LC will accompany any draw that is made for 
endorsement of the drawing amount and that it will be returned to the 
Beneficiary unless it is fully drawn upon.  


I don't see any problem with this and while it may be unnecessary, if it 
males them feel better to have it, i would like to keep it in.  Are you okay 
with this?

Carol
