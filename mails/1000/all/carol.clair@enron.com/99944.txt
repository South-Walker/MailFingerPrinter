Leslie and Elizabeth:
I should have sent this to you as well.    Could you please take a look at 
this form and let me know if it is okay with you?  Seems like there are more 
situations that are coming up where our counterparties are wanted to execute 
1 Guaranty to cover all types of transactions and this is our attempt to 
develop a form that credit can use.   I look forward to hearing from you.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry:
 We have developed a form of multi-product counterparty Guaranty that is a 
little different from our old form of counterparty Guaranty.  The main 
difference is the deletion of the 15 day cure period in Section 2.  Can you 
please take a look at this and let me know if you are okay with this as 
something credit can send to counterparties?
Thanks.
