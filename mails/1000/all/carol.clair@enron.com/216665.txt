Janet:
I left my comments in your chair.  I think that we need to decide how these 
provisions work with Article 8 of the EEI Master, particularly Sections 
8.1(c), 8.2(c),  and 8.3.  My vote would be to replace the language in the 
EEI master with the provisions that you drafted so that everything is in one 
place.      Let me know what you think.
