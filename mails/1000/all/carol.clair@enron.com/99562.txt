Susan:
In preparation for our forms meeting next week could you please have your 
secretary prepare sets of the latest versions of the following for the group 
(Jason included):

1. ISDA Schedule 
2. CSA Schedule plus LC provisions
3. Industrial Master 
4. Annex A  - ENA and ECC
5. Annex B to Omnibus Form (include all collateral variations)
6. Canadian and US Tax Annexes
7. Guaranty Form 
 
Did I miss any forms that we should talk about?


If they could be distributed by Monday  - Noon, that would be great.  Thanks.

Carol
