Stephanie:
I am helping Jane McBride in our Japan office with the ISDA Masters for 
Japanese banks.  Can you help me get these drafted in the next few days?  I 
will send you in a separate e-mail the forms of ISDA and CSA Schedules that 
we use when drafting these Masters for Japanese entities.  Thanks.

John,

Attached are the worksheets for Yasuda, Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Fuki Bank, and Toa 
Reinsurance.  Sorry for the delay in getting these over to you.  Please call
