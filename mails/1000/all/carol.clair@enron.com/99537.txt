Mary:
I have left a message with John that I have received approval from Dave to 
give them a bilateral termination right.  I will send them the language 
shortly.

In talking to this customer, he said that he has not heard from anyone at 
Enron regarding this question.  Could you update me on this request?

Thanks,

John Puett, Duke Energy Corporation, wonders if Duke Energy can discontinue 
contract as stated in 6.a, which states that EnronOnline can terminate 
contract.  
Will you please call John (704-382-4061) regardng this question?

Thanks, Carol, and have a wonderful weekend.
