Sara:
Sempra Energy Trading Corp. has requested that in lieu of them signing every 
single confirm that we send them that they sign periodically a statement that 
lists all of the outstanding deals where they acknowledge that they agree to 
the terms of such deals.  Do you see any problem with that?
