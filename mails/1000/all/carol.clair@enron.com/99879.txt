Tana:
Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have 
sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection 
is that maybe only 1 or 2 did.

Carol,

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. 
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana 
be handling the change notification?

Dave
