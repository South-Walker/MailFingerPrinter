Carol,

I am not sure whether I sent a copy of the insurance policy to you earlier, 
so I am attaching a copy to the note.  This policy is mostly complete and 
reflects all the exclusions that AC would include after our discussion with 
them.  I would like to set up a time with you Monday to discuss this further.

Regards 

Gaurav Babbar
