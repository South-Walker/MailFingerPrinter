Maria:
Could you please send me a redline of the Guaranty Agreements and LC (either 
by fax or e-mail) that crosses through and/or underlines the changes that 
were made?  Also, please send me a redline (either by fax or e-mail) of both 
the CSA (when it is ready) and ISDA Schedules that underlines or crosses 
through the changes that were made so that I can sign off on this.  The fax 
that I received did not indicate all chnages that were made in this way.  
Thanks.

Carol
