Brant and Sara:
Here is a very rough draft of a proposed letter agreement for NGTS.  It 
requires some work but hopefully it's a start.  It cannot be finalized until 
we see all of the physical and financial confirms and agreements and should 
NOT be sent to NGTS until Sara and I are comfortable that it works.
