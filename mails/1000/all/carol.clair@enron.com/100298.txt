Sarah:
I am a friend of Trina Chandler's and am currently looking for a full time 
nanny to take care of my 4 month old.  Trina mentioned to me that you had a 
temp a few months ago that was looking for a full time position.  Do you know 
if she is still available?  If so, please call me at home at 281-890-7122 or 
e-mail me.  If you know of anyone else that may be looking for a job, please 
keep me in mind.  How did you find your nanny?
