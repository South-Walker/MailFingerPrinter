Tana:
I sent to Luke Mickum a new draft of the Engage US amendment.  He never did 
send me his comments.  The file with the new draft will be with the files 
near the window just in case.   He wants to resolve the US one before we 
resolve the Canada one.  Coastal is now going to Guaranty the US one.  I'm 
not yet sure if they will also Guaranty the Canada one so we might end up now 
with 2 separate guarantys.  I'll keep you posted.
