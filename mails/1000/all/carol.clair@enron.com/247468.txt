Susan and Susan:
Marie and I are going to attempt this week to send out to all of our omnibus 
counterparties the revised form of Annex A.  We are trying to complete this 
by this Friday.  This may involve a significant amount of Marie's time  which 
may result in you having to cover for her on new matters this week if she 
needs help.  Thanks.

Carol
