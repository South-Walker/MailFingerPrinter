Here is my first cut at a proposed form of amendment.  I have added a rep and 
an additional Event of Default to cover the 'Lien" issue in light of the fact 
that Barrett's Credit Agreement restricts them from entering into any 
agreement that contains a negative pledge.  I winged the amendment to the 
Confirmations since I have not seen them yet.  Please call me with any 
comments.
