Mark and Jarrod:
Regarding this project of streamlining weather confirms, Shari asked about 
the new language that we were gong to use to define the procedures for 
determining the Fallback reference Weather Station.  Has that language ever 
been finalized?  This is one of the things that I thought we could pull out 
of the confirms so before we send out any Master Agreement amendments, we 
should try to get this language finalized.
