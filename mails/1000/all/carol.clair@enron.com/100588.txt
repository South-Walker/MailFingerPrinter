I would reccommend sending out notice of trigger of Material Adverse Change 
and calling for margin.  Can we prepare the notice..Bob Crane is in agreement.

Thanks,
Tanya

We have financial exposure of 4.2MM to United States Gypsum company which may 
file Ch. 11 due to mounting asbestos claims.  S&P has not taken any action 
since Jan when they lowered ratings to BB-/Negative and removed from Credit 
Watch.  However, USG announced today that it is considering "strategic 
alternatives", one of which is Chapter 11due to increased litigation. I'll 
forward the article.
