Scott:
Mark Holsworth suggested that I send this draft Agreement to you which 
provides for Enron's transfer of the domain name weather-desk.com.  I am 
particular concerned about our ability to make the reps in Section 3.  What I 
am sending you reflects our comments to the other party's draft.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.
