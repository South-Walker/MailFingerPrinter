Jeff:
Alicia and I will get back to you with a mark-up with our thoughts on this 
since some of the langugae appears to be different from what is in the 
Revolver.  Alicia thought that maybe this langugae came from Condor.  My 
objective here is to make sure that there is some good precedent for this 
language and that this deal does not create a new standard.
