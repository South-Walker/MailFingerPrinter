Bill and Tanya:
Enclosed is a list of "follow-up" items that we came up with based on what we 
talked about last Friday.  Maybe some of these can be discussed at our next 
group meeting next week so that we are clear on who is handling which issue.  
Feel free to send me any thoughts you may have on these issues.  We really 
appreciate the enthusiasm that your group has for these seminars and look 
forward to doing more of them in the future.
