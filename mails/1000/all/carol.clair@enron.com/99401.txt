Gaurav:
Thanks for the info.  I left a voice mail for Lou Stoler about the need to 
get outside counsel involved and he is going to look into that.  I will send 
you the CA shortly as it is in the process of being prepared.  I also spoke 
with Elizabeth Sager in the power group about assisting in the documentation 
of the derivative and she has agreed to help.  It may be a good idea to 
schedule a meeting with me, Elizabeth, Lou , you and others to walk through 
the derivative piece in more detail so that the power folks can ask you 
questions about it.  My assistant Suzanne Adams has my schedule (37340),  
Elizabeth's assistant is Brenda Whitehead (35438) and Lou's assistant is Dina 
Snow (57099).
