Sara:
Looks like the 15th works for everyone.  I look forward to seeing you both 
then.  All of the St. Clair's are doing well.  It's hard to believe that 
Charles will soon be 4 months.  Time really does fly by and I am really 
enjoying my stay at home with him.  I look forward to hearing from the both 
of you about work.  See ya.

Hey, Carol!  November 15 looks like a great day.  Any other day (except 
Friday) could work.  Sara
