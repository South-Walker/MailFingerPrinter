Mike:
Thanks for your message.  I have moved into a new group but send me the 
redraft and I will forward it to the appropriate person in the swap group.

Carol:

I left Oxy at the end of March, but have been asked to continue to do some 
work for them, including trying to put the ISDA "to bed".

If you are still at this address, I will try to get you a redraft based on 
your last comments in a few days, at which point we can discuss where we need 
to go from there.
