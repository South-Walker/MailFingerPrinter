David:
Thanks.  Per my voice mail messgae, are you okay with giving Cinergy the 
right to terminate?  This apparently is there only issue.  Also, how do you 
want to handle future requests for termination rights if we can't geta 
counterparty to back down from their request?  Do you want me to check with 
you each time?
Carol
