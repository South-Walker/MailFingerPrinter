Mr. Giordano:
At Caroline Abramo's request, I am sending you the confirms for the 14 
transactions that ENA has done with ENA.  Each of these confirms is the same 
for each of the 2 Catequil entities except for the specific terms which are 
set forth on the first few pages.  The last 2 documents that I have attached 
are the templates that we used to create each confirm.  If you have any 
questions, please call Caroline Abramo.  Thank you.
