Christian:
I sent out the Schedules to Jeff Brown by e-mail and faxed him and Laird the 
preprinted ISDA and CSA.  Ed Sacks seems to think that they are a German 
company.  I have asked then for more information.  Laird is hot to get this 
"signed up" on Monday.  I am out on Monday but if necessary, Sara or Mary 
Cook can help you.  Marie Heard is the legal assistant.  I will be checking 
my voice mail messages but will be out of pocket from Noon-5 on Monday.
