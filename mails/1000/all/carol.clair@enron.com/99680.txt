That sounds good. Do you want me to see if Janet Greene and Midge can go?

Hi Carol. I'm really thrilled for you. How long do you plan to stay out?

     Scott and Andrea are having a baby! So I'll be a grandmother in
November. The first draft is on the web--a sonogram.

     How about June 5 - 8 any day for lunch?  Pam

Pam:
How are things with you?  I am doing great and feeling great!  I've got
about
another 8 weeks to go and I'm looking forward to getting this part over
with.  I
hope to work until pretty close to the end if my doctor lets me.  Are you
free
for lunch anytime soon?  I would love to see you and catch up.  E-mail me
back
with some good dates and hopefully we can get together.  Tell Patti I said
hi.

Carol
