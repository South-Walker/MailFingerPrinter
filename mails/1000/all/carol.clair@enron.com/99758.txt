David:

I don't want to meet until the report with all of the categories has been  
completed.  Just let me know when that is.  Again, the categories are as 
follows:
 -  # of unsigned confirms
 - total exposure of deals whose confirms have not been executed
 - # of deals with unsigned confirms whose term is in excess of 1 year
 - has the counterparty ever signed confirms?
 - reason for not signing confirms

Would you be interested in meeting today at 430?

Russell Diamond is back from London, so we will be meeting today or tomorrow 
with our new report needs,

I'll keep you updated.

Any luck with Morgan, Williams, or any other updates?

Thanks
David
