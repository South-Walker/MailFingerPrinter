Sara:
I just wanted to finally congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion to 
AGC!  I am really, really happy for you, as you are one of the primary 
reasons why I have chosen to stay in this group.  I would like to take you 
out to lunch to celebrate and will ask Suzanne to get in touch with Kay to 
get a date that is good for both of us.  Again, congrats on a tremendous 
accomplishment.
