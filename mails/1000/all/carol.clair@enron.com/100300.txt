Suzanne:
Can you tell me who my HR rep is?  How was your Thanksgiving?  Our was 
great.  I'm meeting with Mark Haedicke today so I will call you later.  Talk 
to you soon.

PS  We are beginning the "nanny" search.  If you know of anyone or hear 
someone talk about someone that might be looking for a job, please let me 
know.  Thanks.
