David:
I would prefer to wait until next Tuesday to meet, particularly in light of 
the luncheon with your group that we are having.  Is that okay with you?  In 
the meantime, I am working with credit to finalize the SG Interests Master 
and when I asked Sara about Williams, she indicated that she had not spoken 
with them about confirmation issues.  Do we have a contact there?  I also 
have a call into Morgan.  Finally, I mentioned to Mark Taylor how we were 
trying to prioritize our list and he identified 2 other categories in 
addition to # of unsigned confirms and Exposure amounts.  He thought that it 
was important to only focus on those transactions that were greater than 1 
year in duration from the outset and also to focus on those counterparties 
who have never signed confirms.  Can you add these to your list of categories?
