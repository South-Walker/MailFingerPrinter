Tana:
I was hoping that as part of our next group meeting on the 21st you could put 
something together with respect to the various seminars that we hope to have 
with the different groups that we work with as I would very much like to 
start setting dates for these seminars with the hope that they could be 
completed before I go on maternity leave.  Is that do-able?
