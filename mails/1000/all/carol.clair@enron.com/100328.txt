Mark:
Thanks and I'm delighted that everyone is enjoying it!  Tell Bob that I need 
to come back in order top earn enough $$$ to pay for it!  Hope to see you 
soon.  I'm going to try to set up a meeting with you, me and Mark for 
sometime next week if possible.

Thanks so much for the Christmas present.  Everyone is enjoying it very 
much.  Bob Bruce's first reaction was "Wow -- I hope this isn't in lieu of 
her ever coming back!"
