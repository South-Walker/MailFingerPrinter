Suzanne:
Could you obtain a few of each of these for me or if they are available 
on-line let me know where?  We alos need to talk about getting my office 
ready for the move.  Please stop by when you can.  Thanks.
Carol

Carol,

I thought of some other forms we may need during  the next 6 months.? If the 
forms shown below are readily available, could  you bring a couple of them 
home?
?
Medical Claim Form
Dental Claim Form
Employee Expense Reimbursement Form

Hope you are feeling well today!

Thanks,
Bill
