Judy:
I work with Mark Taylor in the financial derivatives group.  One of our 
business people has asked Mark Haedicke whether our back office group run by 
Sally Beck could perform back office functions for a third party pipeline.  
It is my understanding that this group is a part of Enron Networks which is a 
subsidiary of Enron Corp.  Please call me when convenient to discuss.
